But not really. I don't know if the ski is soluble. I don't think so. Right. Yeah. And also, that's what I have at home. And I think they said this is like omega-3. Yeah. Yeah. And I think they said that it's kind of like the children's four years or older. Now. Choose four dummies 123 TimesDaily. How? How much? Per pill. I think it's here. OK. That's very little. Yeah, that's very little. Yeah. What I saw is like not does it work because like I said, is that going dating like 3123? I was like, OK, no, because I saw like the sugar. Sugar component was like to do anything. What about like the like the one that I really like that big we have like someone? Something like that. I mean, it's gonna have at least 1000 milligrams combined. DHAAEPA, yeah. But isn't it too little? No. That 1 was great right? The one that has like. You can swallow. But like this one, it's kind of like, I think, I think it's for extrusion, but. It's useless. It's useless, right? Yeah, okay. Thank you. Thank you. None. None. None. Is is there something confusing about the first paragraph that I put on there? Is it not clear what wall means? Because there's no camera coverage of you, there's cameras in the room taking pictures of the. Doesn't cover those for. Attendance. No, no, no. It's nothing to do with grades. It's for statistics, no? OK, let's get going. As you can see, I modified the the syllabus because I thought that the February 3rd lecture was a bit too close to the exam. So this is going to be the last lecture that's covered on the exam. So you have 4 lectures for this midterm. There will be 4 for the second midterm and there will be 5 for the final. And I told you there would be some readings. So there's a reading that is posted on my courses. It's a scientific paper which I want you to get into the habit of reading to see what scientific papers are all about. And there'll be one or two questions on that on the on the exam. All right. So last time we talked about vitamins, which were organic compounds that we need in the diet because the body can't make them. And in that context, of course, we use the term organic. As to containing carbon. Well, now we're going to move along to the other class of micronutrients and these are the minerals which of course do not contain carbon and they are just as essential as the vitamins. Generally, we need them in very small amounts, but they make an important contributions to our health. There are a large number of minerals that we need in order to maintain health. We obviously cannot talk about all of them. So I've just chosen 4, which I think are interesting and important to talk about. We're going to talk about calcium, we'll talk about magnesium, we'll talk about iodine and we'll talk about iron. The others are somewhat less important, but we still need them in the diet. However, they are not very difficult to get in the diet because they are present in almost all foods. So let's start with calcium and the periodic table, which I'm sure conjures up some horrific memories of your high school chemistry, but it's basically a symbol of chemistry and it has an amazing history. The periodic table, of course, is an arrangement of the elements in such a way that they are in in vertical rows which signify that they have like chemical properties. So when we look at calcium, it is in the same family, as you can see as magnesium. So it means that they will have similar chemical properties. It's a very important feature of chemistry, which was first put together by Dmitry Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, in the 1800s. And now, of course, the periodic table is featured in every chemistry classroom. But the largest periodic table in the world is just around the corner from the institute where Mendeleev worked. It's in Dilma, Russia, And there it is, the giant periodic table, the largest one in the world. You know what is very interesting about that? It's in Russia. What's so interesting about it? The language is in English. Yeah, because the universal language of chemistry is English. The major chemistry textbooks in the world are in English, and almost all of the scientific literature is in English. Whether it's published in France, China or Japan, they publish it in English. So let's move along and talk about calcium. Of course, what we will be mostly interested in is the role of calcium in the diet. But we do have to get into just a touch of chemistry here, which of course for most of you will be old hat. But there are some who have not had any chemistry at all. Everything in the world, of course, is made-up of atoms, and atoms in turn are made-up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is what determines what that element is. So carbon, hydrogen, oxygen differ in the number of protons that they have in their nucleus. The electrons that circulate around the nucleus determine the chemical properties of the substance and the kind of chemical reactions in which it can engage. This is somewhat of a simplified picture. Of course. The electrons don't rotate in orbits around the nucleus the same way that the Earth rotates around the sun. They go all over the place at a fixed distance from from the nucleus. There are two important features that we have to take into account here, and that is the loss or gain of electrons by an atom. When a neutral atom loses an electron, it becomes positively charged because electrons are negative. Then it becomes what we call a cation, and if it gains an electron, it becomes an anion. Let's take a look very quickly at calcium. Calcium has a number of electrons rotating around the nucleus in what we call orbitals, and the stability of the atom or its chemical stability and and the extent to which it wants to engage in reactions is determined by whether or not these orbits are filled. And orbits can have either 2 electrons or 8 electrons anyway. We don't need to get into that kind of complication, except that calcium can stabilize itself by losing 2 electrons to become a calcium plus plus ion, which then has a completed outer shell. So the difference between an ion and the atom is that an ion has either or. An atom has either lost or gained an electron. That's how it becomes an ion. When we talk about calcium as a metal, this is what it looks like. That is made-up of calcium atoms which are neutral. However, most of the time when we talk about chem chemicals in the body, it's not the elemental form that we're talking about, it's compounds. So for example, the one of the major compounds of calcium would be calcium carbonate, which is made-up of a calcium ion and the carbonate ion. Calcium carbonate is basically chalk, and when it is all in a mineral put together, a mineral deposit, it becomes limestone. And if you've ever been to to England and had the chance to see the White Cliffs of Dover, that is pure limestone. That's calcium carbonate. But limestone is also the major construction material in the world. The Sphinx and the pyramids were basically made of limestone, so it's one of the substances that was well known to the ancient world. The Parthenon in Greece is supported by limestone columns, but it's not only an antiquity that limestone was used. Limestone is also the major constructive material of the Empire State Building. So obviously calcium is, is all over, but what we'll be interested in is the role that it plays in, in, in the body. Well, when you take calcium carbonate and you heat it, you drive off carbon dioxide. And what is left behind is calcium oxide. And it is from calcium oxide that calcium as a metal was first isolated. And that takes us back to the 1800s, early 1800s. And Humphrey Davy, one of the most brilliant chemists of all time, and he took some molten calcium oxide and passed an electric current through it with a battery. So a battery can release electrons, which it did in this case, so that the calcium ions in calcium oxide pick up the electrons and become calcium metal that then plates out on the electrode. At the other electrode, the oxygen negative ions give up their electrons and become oxygen, elemental oxygen. So you have a current flowing through here and you have calcium metallic calcium building up on the on the electrode. Now of course this was only made possible because the battery had already been invented and that happened a few years earlier in 1800. Alessandro Volta, the Italian physicist who discovered that if you have alternating copper and zinc pieces of metal separated by water soaked into tissue paper, and you connected wires to the top and the bottom, a current would flow. Dissimilar metals will produce a current. So anyway, the battery made possible the separation of calcium from calcium oxide. Now when we think of calcium in the context that we're talking about in terms of health and and nutrition, we of course think of our skeleton because that, as we say, is made of calcium. Well, of course it is not made of metallic calcium. We're not. We don't have a skeleton made of metal. It is made of a calcium compound. And that calcium compound, it's pretty complicated. It's called hydroxyapatite, Hydroxyapatite. And if you want to have a a better idea of how what it really looks like, it's ions of phosphate and hydroxyl and calcium that are put together in this kind of framework. When we talk about calcium as being present in food, of course, again, we're not talking about calcium metal. We're talking about compounds of calcium. And the reason that we are talking about these is because that's where the calcium in our skeleton comes from. Everything in our body has to come from our food supply. So calcium has to be present in in food. It of course also has to be absorbed into our bloodstream to be deposited in the skeleton. And as you remember last time when we were talking about vitamin D, we said that vitamin D is critical because it enhances the absorption of calcium into the bloodstream through the intestinal wall. And vitamin D is formed in the body from a precursor that comes from the diet upon exposure to ultra rot light, which comes from from the sun. So calcium cannot be absorbed. We cannot have a skeleton if it is not for vitamin D. And we talked last time about what happens if you have a deficiency of vitamin D and that gives rise to a condition known as rickets. And I told you that this became quite widely observed during the Industrial Revolution in England, when there was so much smoke produced from all the new fangled engines that were being developed that the sky was basically obscured and sunlight would not get through. And then somehow, accidentally, they discovered that if you ate cod liver oil, this would treat the condition. They didn't know why. Of course. They didn't know that it contained vitamin D. Once the science of vitamin D was worked out, though, there was another treatment to make sure that you had enough vitamin D. And I remember this because I had this done to me and we were all heralded into a room and we sat there for a few minutes while ultraviolet light, we were exposed to ultraviolet light and this was supplementation with vitamin D. Today that's no longer done because people do go out in the sun. And of course, many of our foods, like our milk, are supplemented with vitamin D. So once you have calcium in your bloodstream, how does it form bone? Well, we know this as well. There are two types of bell cells that are important in in bone formation, osteoclasts and osteoblasts. One of them forms bone, the other one dissolves, or the term that is used is resorbs bone. You can remember this with a little mnemonic there. Osteoclast the C chips away bone. Osteoblast B. It builds bone. Bone is a is sort of a repository for calcium, because as you will see, calcium is needed for many body functions, and if you don't have enough in the diet, your bones will release some. Now early on in life, the rate at which bone is formed and at which bone resorbs are roughly equivalent and your skeleton builds and it is healthy. As we get older, there's a change bone resorption out muscles, bone formation, so your bone becomes weaker and weaker. And this of course is what you refer to as osteoporosis. And osteoporosis can happen anywhere in the body to any bones, including, of course, the bones that make up the spine, which is why we have the situation that you see here. As we get older, the the bones in the spine become weaker. They cannot maintain the weight of the body. And you start to see the the curvature, it affects women more than men actually, because estrogen is also important in the way that calcium is deposited into into bone. And as you know, after menopause, women produce much less estrogen. So that is paralleled with the increased risk of osteoporosis, which is also why women at risk for osteoporosis are prescribed estrogen because that will reduce the risk. But there again, you have to weigh the risks and the benefits because estrogen has a small risk and increasing breast cancer. So you have to know which is, you know, which way you're going to go, determined by how big the risk is for osteo osteoporosis. But osteoporosis can be serious because it strikes so many, so many people. And when you have a fracture in your senior citizen hood, it causes many complications. You can have blood clots forming, you can have infections. So it is a pretty serious business. What can you do to prevent it? Well, there are several approaches. One that I think has to be really emphasized because we are not learning more and more about this. And that is the role of exercise. And you know, I mean, I've been beating that drum for a while with you telling you about all the benefits of of exercise. And so it is with reducing the risk of osteoporosis. But the kind of exercise, you know, that cardiovascular exercise is excellent for everything. All right, this is great for your arteries. It's it's it's great for your every organ in your body, but this is not what you need to reduce the risk of osteoporosis. For that, you need weight bearing exercise. You have to lift weights. And people who go through life lifting weights are much, much less prone to developing brittle bones. But you know, it's, it's not just taking your 5K weights and, you know, doing this a few times, it has to be regular. And you try to increase the weight that you can, you can lift. That's the best protection against osteoporosis. Now, once it already strikes, then there are interventions. There's a medication that is used, which is Fosamax, and it is quite commonly prescribed. And what it does is it reduces the breakdown of bones because it inhibits the osteoclasts. Remember these are the cells that chip away at the at the bone and it works pretty well. Of course there's a but isn't there always because with every medication, could you please move into the middle and not sit on the side? There's a risk and the risk is necrosis of the jaw, which sounds terrible. It is terrible because it bizarrely the bones of the jaw start to to break down. It is a very rare occurrence, but you know, rare is not 0. Another very bizarre side effect of Fosamax, which of course is designed to prevent you from breaking bones, is that it has an increased risk of breaking the femur. No one I can explain why that is. Again, the risk here is very, very small, so a doctor will have to weigh by, you know doing bone scan, see just how porous your bones are and decide what treatment is is appropriate. Now the newest treatment is a type of monoclonal antibody and it's called Prolia, which is injected a very effective it. It basically interferes with the formation of osteoclasts, so obviously you don't get the breakdown of of bones. The big problem here is, is actually expense. Prolia is very expensive and in Quebec it is only covered by RAMQ if someone has been on bisphosphonates and it has not worked for them. Of course, you can always pay privately. It's very expensive, but it's a very effective medication. It is obvious that calcium plays a major role in formation of our bones, but that is not the only role that calcium plays. Calcium has many other functions in the body. It is very important for the way that our nerves function. It's very important the way that our heart functions. So it's not only the skeleton. And I gave you some more information here that you can read at your own leisure about all the things that calcium can do. So, you know, it's, it's kind of a, you know, mistaken belief that it's only important for bone formation. Of course, the question that we have to ask is how much calcium do we need to take in to meet the body's needs? Well, this has been extensively investigated and it depends on on age, but if you want to sort of keep a ballpark figure in mind, 1000 milligrams, that's about especially at your age, that's about what you need to take in. As you get older, if other risk factors come up, then you have to to increase. How do we know this? How would you go about determining how much calcium the body needs? It's actually not that difficult. What you need to do is calculate how much calcium there is in in a meal and then extract from the urine, see how much has been retained by the body. You do this a number of times and you get an idea of how much is is retained. So that's how we get those numbers. And we also have a very, you know, good idea of where calcium is found in foods that can be relatively easily determined these days by using something called atomic absorption spectroscopy. And so here, here are the numbers. Take a few seconds here, look at this and see if you can just in your mind add up. If you think that you are in the ballpark of 1000 milligrams a day, the major, major one, of course, calcium, 310 milligrams in a glass of milk, I would venture that very few of you are in the 1000 milligram category who is sure that they are mostly for milk. Yeah, 1000 milligrams is actually, you know, a significant amount. Now there's a further complication here. Life is complicated and that is that. Well, calcium is there in those foods. Absorption is not the same because some of those foods contain something we call oxalate, which binds the calcium. So while in a chemical test you can take your lettuce and find how much calcium, doesn't mean it can all get into your bloodstream. So what we need is, you know, calcium bioavailability. And as you can see, you know that that differs a great deal. So yeah, well, spinach does contain calcium. Look at the number of servings of spinach you would have to have to equal to one glass of milk. 16 servings of spinach. You probably haven't eaten that in your life, never mind in one day, right? So bioavailable is important and calcium from milk is especially bioavailable. There's a lot of people of course who are anti milk. We've talked about that. But there's no question that it is the best way of getting calcium into your body. There are others. I mean, today you can buy foods that are fortified with calcium. You can see your orange juice is fortified with calcium and that's good. I mean, that then becomes a good source of, of of calcium. But something else to keep in mind here when you're looking at that orange juice is the sugar content 24 grams serving. That is a lot of sugar, right? When we take into account that you're looking at 90 grams of sugar, you know, and your daily consumption of which only 40 should should be added sugar. The other question that comes up is vegans or vegetarians, right? I mean, such a vegans who don't consume any any dairy, you don't see them melting away with no bones, right? So there is calcium elsewhere too. But you have to be more knowledgeable. You have to be more careful in in knowing where. But as you can see, tofu is a pretty good source of that. And you see that it's not easy to get 1000 milligrams. So they're certainly, there are a lot of people who don't get enough calcium in their diet and then they look to calcium supplements and there are many different kinds of calcium supplements. And we'll, we'll take a look at that. But first, historically, the first calcium supplement ever was taken by Cleopatra's lover, Mark Antony. And this was a very interesting story. Probably apocryphal. Doesn't matter, it's a good story. Cleopatra supposedly made a bet with Mark Antony that she could supply him with the most expensive meal that he ever had. Well, it seems that Mark had had some big meals before, so he took the bet and at that point Cleopatra reached up, took her earring and dropped it into a glass of vinegar and asked him to drink it. And indeed, he had the most expensive meal that he had ever consumed because the the Can you please not sit in the back behind the aisle there? Can you move down, please? There's a reason that I tell you that, so please do it. So anyway, so it turned out that it was a very valuable Pearl. And when you take a Pearl, which is made of calcium carbonate, the same stuff that we talked about, that limestone is made of, and you put it into vinegar, acetic acid, it dissolves and you get calcium acetate, which is a very easily absorbable form of of calcium. So indeed, Marc Anthony had the most expensive meal that he had ever had. It's an interesting story. And of course, vinegar promoters make use of that. As you can see. Do not sit in the places beside the wall or behind the aisle. I've asked you that every single lecture. OK, You sit in the three areas here. There's a reason because that is the only where we have camera coverage. All right, Of course, the story is probably an apocryphal story, but nevertheless, you know, it's interesting because in theory, you know, you could take a parole and dissolve it in in vinegar and get a calcium supplement. We don't do that. We actually take calcium supplements in a different form. There are many different forms. But when we say that that is a calcium supplement, obviously you're talking about some compound of calcium, and those compounds of calcium can have different amounts of calcium. If you're talking about calcium carbonate, the amount of calcium in there is not the same as what you would get in calcium citrate, right? The weight, the molecular weights there are, are very different. So you can see that that some have much more calcium available and you have to be cognizant of that fact. And sometimes it's confusing because when you look at the label of a supplement, not sure really what that means. I mean, what does that label mean? 1200 milligrams of calcium, does it refer to the calcium ion that is in the calcium carbonate or is it the whole calcium carbonate that makes a big difference right in your calculation? It's impossible to tell from there. So really what you want to to to look at on on a bottle is clear statement of the amount of calcium that is in there. You see the second one there that would do well because you're looking at calcium and they tell you that it's calcium X milligrams from calcium carbonate. You can also get calcium together with vitamin D, which is pretty good because of course you need vitamin D for calcium absorption. And this is something that would be recommended by a doctor after having done a bone scan and seeing that that the bone is osteoporotic. The good, bad and the ugly of calcium is a is a good way to to look at it because there are some issues that that arise. So I said, you know, things are are, you know, pretty complicated. Now this paper is a meta analysis where they looked at all the studies that have been done on, on calcium, the pros and the cons. So here is 1 for example. And it's quite clear if you look at the the bottom of the conclusion there is that while they did find that calcium supplements increased bone mass, it did not necessarily decrease fractures. That's a very important point because what's the reason that you're taking a supplement to prevent a fracture? Not to have the doctor look at the scan and see that the density of the bone is, is greater. There are many, many studies that were taken into account in that meta analysis. Here's one that is somewhat concerning because here they found that people who take calcium supplements are in fact at somewhat greater risk of cardiovascular events, not tremendously. You can look at it here graphically. And if you take a look at the first one, heart attack, you can see the the red line. That's the one that describes people are taking calcium supplements and it is somewhat above the the line where people are not taking not much, but it's there. Similarly, there are some other complications with with kidney function etcetera. Now the cardiovascular disease is is is concerning and the reason for that is because we have scientific plausibility. When you look at deposits in arteries that lead to heart attacks, you do find calcium there. Calcium gets all built up together with cholesterol with together with fats. And that's why these days they will often do a scan that could looks for calcium in the arteries, because when you get those deposits, that is a risk factor for heart attack. And they do these scans and depending on the amount of calcium that is deposited there, you get a risk analysis for the the possibility of a heart attack. And this is done quite routinely. Now there are a number of other studies that have been done. And you know, this is this is the kind of thing that that you know, makes you crazy. You will look at one study and you find that they you know. Cardiovascular risk goes up. You look at, you know, some other study, they actually find that the risk goes down. That's why we look at, you know, the consensus, not not cherry pick studies. I think today there's good evidence that calcium scan is a is a good thing to do. Not at your age because it, it does give you some idea of, of, of risk, what you do about it. That's a completely different story. And you know, you can also argue that it just creates anxiety for someone to, to know this because you really can't control the, whether the calcium is going to deposit in your arteries or, or or not. But I, I want to go through one study with you here just to show you, you know, how careful you have to be at interpreting studies and how the media can influence public opinion in basically somewhat of an irrational way. So here's a study, look at the headline diet wide analysis for risk of colorectal cancer, prospective study, etcetera, etcetera. And, and, you know, when you start talking about colorectal cancer, you, you pay attention because this is not one of it's not a rare cancer. I mean, you know, unfortunately, there's no question that a number of you many, many years from now will have the disease. I mean, that's just what, you know, statistics say. So based upon this study, there were headlines and here they are. Increased calcium and dairy intake lower risk of bowel cancer by nearly 1/5. Sounds good? Glass of milk a day cuts bowel cancer risk, study shows. Daily glass of milk may cut bowel cancer risk by fifth, research finds What was this research? It was pretty well done. As you can see, half a million women were asked questions about filling out their diet, etcetera. And then of course over the years some of them got colon cancer and they did the calculation, you know what the risks are. And so it turned out that the women who had a low intake of calcium under 1000 milligrams, which I said is sort of, you know, the average that we should take in, they were at greater risk than the ones who took more, that is, you know, who were in the 1000 to 1100 ballpark. OK, So this is what the study showed. But the headlines very often had a number in them like this. A daily glass of milk reduces bowel cancer by 17%. That sounds like something you should really pay attention to, but percentages can be very, very misleading. Here's the story. What they normally calculate in studies like this is what we call the hazard ratio, or HR. This is a measure of the likelihood that in any population, someone develops a disease. That is what percent of people in the study develop a certain disease. It may be a high percent or a low percent, but what you're looking for is how it compares to a control group where you have not intervened. You're looking for the difference in the percent of the disease in the experimental group and in the control group. Here is the the data that the 70% derives from. So the people in this study were were divided into quintiles, that is five segments depending on the amount of calcium that they consumed in their diet. And as you can see the low calcium people had an average of 828 milligrams, the highest quintile over 1100. And then they calculate the HR, the hazard risk. And as you can see, the highest quintile .83, that's where the 17 percent, 1 to 83.83, that's where the 17% comes from. But you have to ask 17% of what, right? What is the chance that a person will get colon cancer in general without an intervention? And then you ask, what is the chance that they will get colon cancer if they're taking calcium? And then you compare those two. That's the realistic way. So here we go. Your lifetime risk of colon cancer is about 4%. OK. So 40 out of 1000 women in this study would be diagnosed with this disease. If that is decreased by 17%, What it really translates to, as you can see as I I showed you here, is less than one in 100, which it's quite different from the #17%, right? But that's the realistic number. You have roughly one in a hundred chance of reducing the risk of colon cancer by drinking glass of milk. Incidentally, the word milk was never used in that study. It was nothing to do with milk. It's just that the difference between 800 and 1100 to 300 milligrams is what you happen to have in a glass of milk. That's where that that comes from. So there's a big difference between 70% and one in 100, right? So, yeah, that's why percentages are always misleading. You know, I've told you many times, you know, you you buy 2 lottery tickets, you've increased your chance of winning by 100%. But it's absolutely meaningless, right? Absolute numbers is what we need to look at. Also in this study, turned out that if you drink alcohol, your risk was increased by 17%. That's noteworthy. Also noteworthy is something that wasn't publicized is that if you look at sugar consumption, the risk was decreased. Nobody ever wants to talk about sugar doing any good right now. Of course, no one would suggest that you should increase your sugar intake because this study showed that, but you could milk the study. To do that. You need to show that if you if you wanted to. So there's our calcium story. 1000 milligrams is what you want to keep in mind. Let's move on to magnesium in the same family as as calcium. So it has a very similar chemical behaviour. And our story here starts in Epsom, England, way back in the 17th century, when a farmer dug a well for his cows, but his cows would not drink from the water. He tasted the water why his cows wouldn't drink it, and he found that it tasted bitter. Then for some bizarre reason, he also rubbed it on his leg where he had a skin rash. And he found out the rash got better and he also found that his sore muscles became less sore. Well, it turned out that that water in the well had a high concentration of magnesium sulfate leached out from the from the soil. It has come to be called Epsom salt. You can still go to Epsom in England. Supposedly the well is there good tourist attraction and of course these popularity of Epsom salt soared since that time and today people put it into their bath because they think it will relieve stress or soothe they're aching muscles. They will rub magnesium sulfate balm on their arms and legs. If it makes them feel good, do it. I can tell you there is 0 scientific evidence for this. Magnesium sulfate is not going to be absorbed through your skin, so there's no plausible way that it would do anything. But, you know, the placebo effect can be very valuable and at least it's not dangerous. What we do know that magnesium sulfate will do for sure is make you run to the bathroom because it is a very effective laxative and all magnesium compounds do that. So Epsom salt is sold indeed as a laxative, and if you take it internally, it will do something that's not like rubbing it on the skin. It doesn't have to be magnesium sulfate. Magnesium hydroxide is also available as Philips Milk of Magnesia, and these are very effective laxatives for occasional use. I mean, if you have to use a laxative all the time, then that's an issue that has to be looked into. Magnesium as a metal was also isolated by Humphrey Davy exactly the same way, by putting an electric current through instead of a calcium oxide solution, a magnesium oxide solution, exactly the same chemistry. Now magnesium metal, if you would see the pure metal, it is a bright lustery metal, very light actually. And what is interesting about it is that it is highly, highly combustible. If you take a piece of magnesium and you set it on fire, like putting it to a bust and burner, it will produce a brilliant, brilliant light as it burns and combines with oxygen, becomes magnesium oxide. Indeed, in the early days of photography when film was very insensitive and you needed a lot of light, the photographer would have some magnesium powder. They would like that when they took the picture little bit later as the technology got more sophisticated and we had flash bulbs which you probably have never seen. It contains magnesium ribbon inside. An electric spark would set it on fire and you'd get this brilliant flash. Where you have seen magnesium burst into flame is in fireworks. Fireworks are basically made of gunpowder and when it explodes up in the air it spews out magnesium powder which is heated up and burst into flame generated by the gunpowder. Pure magnesium would be just white. If you have colour then it's magnesium which has some other elements added to it. Strontium nitrate for example, if it's going to be red and etcetera. Blue is a very difficult 1 to get. You rarely see blue fireworks. Your copper compounds will do that, but it's not not very brilliant. Another way where you can make use of the flammability of magnesium, interestingly enough, is encamping. You can buy these little magnesium sticks and when you apply, when you scrape it, the friction generates enough heat to get a spark. So you just take some paper or dry leaves and you scrape a little magnesium on it and it will burst into into flames. You may also have heard of mag wheels right on cars. Well the early so-called mag wheels really were not magnesium. They were magnesium alloys with aluminum and and and zinc because it's very light today they don't use magnesium anymore. So now the so-called mag wheels and you still call them that are made of aluminum with some other metals alloys. Where you will find some pure magnesium is on an airplane because magnesium is so light. And you know that that because when you're talking about flying, weight matters because every bit of weight needs extra fuel. That's why, you know, all the airlines are so happy now about the GLP one agonist, the Ozempic drugs and Waco V drugs, because for every pound that you take off a person, they save a lot of money. And the the calculations already are that the airlines are saving millions already now because of all the people, mostly in the US, who are on the GLP 1 agonist. So when on an airplane on the seat, if you make the bottom part there out of magnesium instead of steel, that's a lot of weight. Believe it or not, they even save a great deal of money by removing 1 olive from the salad when they still used to serve salads. Of course, now that's bygone era, but a couple of years ago they would still serve salads on the airplane. You take out 1 olive from every solid for a year on every airplane. That's a very significant saving in fuel. Hard to believe, but you can do the calculation, show that that is true. Magnesium naturally occurs in the earth. It's, you know, of course not as magnesium metal as various magnesium compounds and there's not very much of it there, but there certainly is enough to mine mine it. We have enough magnesium and like calcium, it can lose 2 electrons and become a magnesium ion. Magnesium in nature occurs in the form of dolomite, just like calcium occurs in the form of of limestone. And that's why the dolomite mountains in in Italy are so-called, well, they're actually called dolomite after the geologist who found that the mineral there was a magnesium compound. And it's very impressive. If you go to the dolomite, you see these giant cliffs and it's all made of magnesium compounds. But perhaps the most important role in nature for magnesium is the fact that it's present in chlorophyll. Chlorophyll, one could argue, is the most important chemical in the world, because without it we wouldn't be here. There would be no life, because all life depends on eating plants, right? We either eat plants directly or we eat the animals that have eaten the plants. Plants cannot grow without photosynthesis. Photosynthesis cannot happen without chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a very complicated molecule, as you can see with a magnesium ion smack in the center of the molecule. The basic idea photosynthesis is that carbon dioxide in the air combines with water under the influence of sunlight and forms oxygen that we breathe and all the sugars that we eat, which make up the bulk of our food because they also get converted to to proteins and to and to fats. But in order for the carbon dioxide and the water to combine under the influence of sunlight, you need chlorophyll. It's a chlorophyll that actually absorbs the sunlight and entered provides the energy for carbon dioxide and water to combine. And that's that's why you will see magnesium sulfate, for example, being added to plants because it provides more chlorophyll. Now, of course, what we're interested in is our body and what we need. There's very little magnesium in the body, but that doesn't mean anything. Sometimes very small amounts can be very important. There are many different functions of magnesium in the body as just like with calcium, it's important again in in nerve transmission. It's very important in in energy release. We talked last time about how adenosine triphosphate is the body's energy currency, but in order for it to break down to adenosine diphosphate, you need some magnesium. So magnesium is critical there. It is also part of many enzymes. Enzymes, remember, are proteins which are biological catalysts that enhance the speed of chemical reactions, but they need cofactors, and in many cases those cofactors are minerals such as magnesium. So the enzyme will not work without the presence of magnesium. And there are numerous chemical reactions that go in our body all the time, which constitute life, that require magnesium. So once again we ask the question, how much? Well, you need less magnesium than calcium. So as you can see, we're well below 1000 milligrams here. It's about a, you know, a quarter to, to half of that. But you, you have an idea of the ballpark figure. It is much easier to get magnesium than than calcium because it is present in so many foods. Now, of course, what's more, it's not present there. It's chunks of metallic magnesium, right? It's present in form of magnesium chloride, magnesium phosphate, I mean numerous different compounds. And as I said, it's not so difficult to, to get enough because you, you, you know, look at something like just a banana that will give you 120 milligrams, combine it with two of these others and then you know, you get up to two 300 milligrams. So this is, is not as critical as calcium, especially because the body has a way of conserving the magnesium. When there is a shortage, the body will secrete less. So magnesium shortages is not, not very common. There are some interesting findings, of course, about magnesium. Beside the fact that the body can more or less conserve it so that you know it's not as critical to to watch in the diet as as as as calcium. But there are some other interesting features where you would think about upping your intake. For example, people who are Alcoholics, they have a deficiency of of magnesium. They would have to to be wary, but of course Alcoholics that don't really care about what they eat Also in in some inflammatory conditions like Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, because the gut is inflamed, nutrients don't get absorbed into the bloodstream as as effectively. So someone who has Crohn's disease, colitis would generally be told to take a magnesium supplement. And people who are diabetics also generally have less magnesium in their body, often because they urinate a lot more and also because they watch their diet more, so they may not be taking in enough. So in this cases, supplements would be recommended. And of course they're easily available. There are a couple of other more esoteric reasons to try magnesium. People suffer from migraines, which of course is a terribly debilitating condition, and it turns out that there is benefit possible from taking magnesium supplements when you have a migraine. I would not say that the evidence is overwhelming, but I would say that, you know, there, there is enough evidence you're going to say I'm showing the studies here, there is enough evidence to give it a try. Because if you really are suffering from migraines, I mean, it's just horrific. You know, you just have to sit in a dark room for days at a time. It's worth trying. Now also curiously, believe it or not, there is a treatment whereby you just rub the magnesium on your forehead. I'm somewhat suspicious of this because I don't see how any magnesium compound is going to get absorbed through the skin. But these microsteal sticks also have a number of other components. You can see peppermint, eucalyptus. Maybe those have some effect on on micro, I don't know. Or maybe it's just the placebo effect. But anyway, I think if you do suffer from migraines, I would I would give a try to 250 milligrams a day of magnesium, not with the stick, but by swallowing the pill. The other possible benefit of of magnesium is in sleep. Again, there are a number of studies on this. The randomized clinical trials really don't show much efficacy, but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence about it. You speak to people, they say they take it and they sleep better. Manufacturers, of course, capitalize on that. And you know, they even sell magnesium supplements for sleep. Doesn't work for me. That, of course, doesn't mean anything. That's just anecdotal, but again, there's no reason not to try it. If you have sleep problems, which you you don't have at your age, your problem probably is waking up. But eventually sleep problems occur. So it's worth a try. But also, if you go into a bookstore these days or you go online, you will see all kinds of books about magnesium being a miracle. It treats absolutely everything and some of these works are actually called the Magnesium Miracle and this one here is by Doctor Carolyn Dean. It is interesting story behind her. Magnesium isn't particularly good for the hair, obviously. Anyway, she advertises herself as the doctor of the future and she will talk in the book about magnesium deficiency, which is all true. If you are really deficient in magnesium, here are all of the terrible things that can happen. This is true, but magnesium deficiency is extremely unlikely. If someone does have a deficiency as diagnosed by blood tests, yes, they could benefit from taking a supplement, but it's almost impossible for someone who has, you know, normal lifestyle, normal diet of a magnesium deficiency. Anyway, she obviously sells a supplement. Dr. created, doctor supported, doctor recommended. She is the doctor, right? And what the hell does a doctor know about creating a supplement that can tell you nothing anyway? Of course, she's got the the rationale here. Doctor Dean's Pico Ionic Magnesium talks about the fact that her supplement is in the picometer range. Pico is is is very small. Pico is 10 to the -9. OK, that's a very small amount. It's a trillionth, right? No 10 to the -12 billionth is 10 to the -9. So this is a totally meaningless statement because the magnesium that you need has to be dissolved in something and every dissolved ion is in the picometer range. This is totally meaningless statement. Anyway, she of course is the creator and she has a podcast and and talks about this. Anyway, I like to tell the story because I have AI guess less than fond memory of Doctor Dean. This goes back about 30 years and I happened to have been at home that morning when a friend of mine calls me and that this was literally what I heard on the phone. Hey, you have to turn on Dini Petty. I didn't know who Dini Petty was, and I sure didn't know how I was to turn her on at 9:00 in the morning. But of course, it's very quickly became apparent that she was a guest, or she was the host of a television talk show called The Deanie Petty Show. And Doctor Dean, less frazzled in those days, happened to be the guest. And as soon as I turned it on, OK, this is what I heard. If you can't pronounce it, you should not be eating it because it's a chemical. So you can imagine that she immediately endeared herself to me and I followed her for a while. It turned out that that she was also a homeopath recommending nonsensical homeopathic remedies. So I had a back and forth with her on e-mail and eventually, you know, I wrote to Dini Petty about criticizing. So she invited me to be a guest on the show. Where, where, where? Of course I laced into her and her nonsensical homeopathic remedies and reflexology or whatever. And by that time, I, I knew that she actually had left Canada because she had her license revoked, as you can see, for all kinds of, of unscientific treatments. I'd like to take some credit for driving throughout the country, but, but I can't. But anyway, she's now in Hawaii and she's still frolicking around and she's got a talk show, she's got a podcast, and she's hyping her yeast, magnesium yeast with RNA drops. Well, when you read the her stupid literature, it turns out that RNA stands for reset and activate. But of course people will think of RNA as as being, you know, an important biochemical silly stuff. Anyway, so there's the magnesium story moving down the periodic table to iodine. I think as soon as you hear iodine, the gland that comes to your mind, or at least should come to your mind is the thyroid gland. Because the thyroid gland produces a hormone that thyroid hormone which has many functions in the body as as you will see, and it's an iodine dependent hormone. It's molecular structure contains iodine. The the Physiology here is, is very interesting. The hypothalamus in, in the brain sent a single sent a signal to the pituitary, which in turn sends a signal to the thyroid. And that is what causes the thyroid to produce the hormone the the thyroxine. If there's too much being produced and there's a feedback loop and the hypothalamus stops sending the message etcetera. So under normal conditions, we synthesize just the right amount of of thyroid hormone, which is a good thing because once more we have a situation where it plays a role in so many different aspects of of our life. Thyroid controls thermal regulation, that body temperature controls the heart rate, many, many different functions. History here is fascinating, as it always is. And we can go back to antiquity, 3600 BC, when Chinese texts already we're referring to an unusual growth of the neck, which of course we would call a goiter, and that it could be treated by ingesting seaweed. Look at the date, it's a long time ago and it worked. We'll see why. The ancient Greeks Hippocrates recommended consuming burnt seaweed to treat goiter. Of course, they had no idea how or why that worked, it just came out of experimentation. And by the 12th century, treatment of goiter with burnt seaweed was actually being taught in medical school. The famous medical schools in at that time were in Italy. So this was a legitimate treatment when Napoleon came around. In the Napoleon, of course, of course he needed gunpowder. Gunpowder is made of three basic components. It is made of saltpeter, which is potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur. At that time, the saltpeter, the critical part, the hardest to get, came from South America and it came from bird poop. Bird poop is almost pure saltpeter, potassium nitrate, and there are these huge deposits in South America, especially on the smaller islands of this. And this was imported into Europe. But during the Napoleonic Wars, France, Napoleon was cut off by the British from their supplies of potassium nitrate in South America. So they had to make the saltpeter and therein lies some interesting chemistry that is going to lead us to iodine. What they knew at that time. This had been known since the Middle Ages. Is that you, if you collect organic waste material, you're in waste plant products, etcetera, and just let them sit. It will ferment. Microbes will go into action and they will break down some of the the compounds in there into calcium nitrate. And calcium nitrate has to then be eventually converted into potassium nitrate to use it as as gunpowder. Well, the chemistry is very interesting. I mean, I don't expect you to know details here, but if you add potassium carbonate, that will convert the calcium nitrate to potassium nitrate. But then you have another question. Where do you get the potassium carbonate or the the. Yeah, the potassium carbonate. Well, in order to get that in turn, you need potassium sulfate, which will react with sodium carbonate and then you have it. But where did you get the sodium carbonate? Don't worry, we're getting to the iodine. Where do you get the sodium carbonate? They got it from seaweed. So extracting seaweed gave you the sodium carbonate. But when you did that, you had some vessels in which this extraction was done that were dirty. And in 1811, Bernard Courtois had to clean one of these containers in which they had used seaweed and extracted sodium carbonate that they needed to make the gunpowder. And he cleaned it out with sulfuric acid because very good cleaning agent. And boy, was he shocked by what he saw, because all of a sudden the contents, the residue in that vessel turned into this brilliant purple colour, this violent vapour, Violet vapour came off. And see what happened here. The sulfuric acid actually reacted with the sodium iodide, which is naturally present in seaweed, and it released the sidene vapour. It would have never happened had it not been for the search for gunpowder, which meant that they had to find a way to get sodium carbonate. So this would have never happened if it wasn't for that. Anyway, that vapor then crystallized into a solid, and these Violet crystals are elemental iodine. So what happened here was that the sulfuric acid, which acts as an oxidizing agent and oxidizing agents can steal electrons. So it took electrons from iodide, it converted into iodine atoms, and two iodine atoms joined together to make elemental iodine. Anyway, that was an amazing observation. And then Gay Lusak recognized that this was an element, and he was the one who actually coined the word for it, iodine, from the Greek for Violet color. However, really the discovery of iodine belongs to Bernard Courtois, who was cleaning out his dirty flask with sulfuric acid and found the vapor, but he did not identify it as an element. Anyway, the the French were very big in science in those days, and Jean Francois Quan de suspected that this iodine that was obviously present at seaweed may have been the stuff that was responsible for the treatment of goiter, you know, which had been known for essentially millennia. So they started to use iodine as a treatment. That worked. And of course then you start exploring to see what else iodine can do. And they found something else. They found that iodine, it was also an effective disinfectant. Joseph Lister, who introduced phenol as an antiseptic, found that iodine also killed bacteria. And in fact, during the Civil War in United States, doctors carried laudanum, which of course is opium, but they also carried iodine to disinfect wounds. It's still available today. You come by tinctrav iodine. You put it on cuts in order to disinfect. And it, it, it does work. Of course, there was a lot of nonsense being promoted about it as well as there usually is. When you discover that something works, then all of a sudden, you know, it becomes miraculous for everything. And as you can see here, a cure for every disease that you've ever heard of, syphilis, cancer, dropsy, that was the tuberculosis. So they, you know, these are outrageous things. But the chemistry of of iodine and the science behind it becomes, of course, much more interesting, much more applied. In the middle 1800s, Adal Shatan showed that iodine deficiency is really what caused the problems in in the thyroid. This is why he's had the goiter. And we'll explain in a minute just why goiter grows. And then yet another Frenchman, as as you can see, said that, look, in order to prevent this disease, why don't we just put it into a common food. And salt, of course, was very common. They didn't believe it at that time, even though he had a paper published on it with and with this correct suggestion. And then Baumann finally discovered iodine in the thyroid gland. So it was clear that iodine was a major player there. And it turned out that the reason that the body needed iodine was to incorporate into thyroxine. Which is the hormone that is made by the thyroid gland. And in 1914 Kendall finally isolated this this hormone. But it was easier at that time not to isolate the hormone, but to use just ground up thyroid from animals to treat humans who were suffering from goiter. And that did work. In fact, today in some health food stores, they still sell the beef thyroid. I mean, total nonsense, but they still, they still do that. Finally in 1926, Harrington synthesized thyroxine, the hormone that the thyroid gland produces. And he deserves a lot of credit for it because as you can see, it's a pretty complicated molecule. And you see why iodine in the diet is needed because there is iodine present in the molecule. So how else would it get in there if it wasn't for the diet? There actually are two slightly different thyroid hormones. They're called T3 and T4. Why? Because 1 contains 3 iodine atoms and the other one contains 4I mean that's the and both of them are active, although 1 is more active than than the other. And T3 is actually the active form. Now when we say active form, it is because it's, it is active in so many different parts of the body. And just like we saw with calcium and magnesium, they are multifunctional. And so it is with with thyroid. And here are all the organs in your body. And of course you you can look at this at your leisure and discover all the reasons why you know the thyroid hormone is important and why iodine has to be present in in the diet. Now, if the thyroid gland does not work properly, if it does not produce enough of the thyroid hormone, you get what we call hypothyroidism. If it produces too much, you get hyperthyroidism. So in one case it's an under active thyroid, in the other case it's overactive. And there are reasons for this and there are clear cut symptoms that you will experience if you have either hypo or hyper. If you do not produce enough thyroid hormone, you have a slower than usual heart rate. Feeling tired is probably the major problem, and weight gain. Sometimes, you know, you will hear people say that the reason that they're gaining so much weight is because they have a hormonal problem and generally what that refers to is thyroid. The truth is that very rarely do people have such malfunctioning thyroids that that is a result of weight gain. There are other results for weight gain, depression certainly that that is seen with hypothyroidism. Now when you produce too much thyroid hormone then you get the opposite effect. You get a very fast heart rate, so fast that sometimes you have difficulty sleeping. You become very sensitive to to heat. So you know these these are very real conditions. And usually though, when you have a thyroid problem, it's picked up because they will do a blood test. It's relatively easy to test for thyroid hormone in the blood and a doctor will test for it. When you have complaints like the ones that I just mentioned here, there are two main conditions that gives rise to hyper and hypothyroidism. These are Graves' disease and Hashimoto's disease, and they're quite the opposite, but they're both autoimmune diseases. These are diseases where the body for some reason attacks itself. No one can explain exactly why this happens, but the IT attacks the the thyroid gland. Graves' disease is hyperthyroidism, Hashimoto's is hypo. Both of them, for different reasons, can form a goiter. In the case of hyper is because the gland is so active it's producing so much hormone that it's growing in size and in the case of Hashimoto's it is not producing enough, so it's trying to grow in size to produce more. So both of these conditions can result in, in goiter, the example that I used here of the for the hyper. You also see the bulging eyes, which is characteristic of of hyperthyroidism. Anyone recognize who that is with those jutting out eyeballs, Miriam? Young Frankenstein. Yeah. And Young Frankenstein, Frankenstein's helper, who is called Igor instead of Igor, is played by Marty Feldman. And I mean, he played many other roles, you know, very recognizable because of the of the eyes. So goiter is when the thyroid gland grows in size and it can be, you know, very large growth. But there is an even bigger problem when you are deficient of thyroid during pregnancy. That is if the mother is deficient or during very early infancy, because thyroid is important for mental function and a condition known as Cretanism ensues if there's not enough iodine present when the baby is is growing. Cretan is is a medical term. I mean, you know, you tend to use it also as an insult. You call people Cretans, but it actually is a medical term to describe someone who has iodine deficiency. And if they do grow up, as you can see in the bottom picture there, they have a very characteristic appearance. And of course, they are mentally challenged. Today, this is rare because every newborn baby is tested for thyroid function. And if there's a problem, it's very easily solved because Synthroid is a thyroid hormone. Today there's even a combination of both the three iodo and the four iodo hormones. So treatment of thyroid problems today is is really quite straightforward. In the case of a really hyper, hyperactive thyroid that is too much, there's a drug, carbamazole. And what this really does is it stops the thyroid gland from reducing the hormone. However it will do so completely so that the thyroid doesn't produce any hormone. And then you have to take Synthroid in order to compensate for what the body is not producing. There's one other really fascinating connection of iodine, and that is in the instance of radioactivity danger. Because unfortunately, when you have a radioactive accident, potassium iodide that is radioactive is released and it concentrates in the thyroid gland and it causes cancer. However, the fact that that radioactive iodine can also cut down on the activity of the thyroid gland can be used therapeutically because you use just a little bit of radioactive thyroid, just enough to destroy a little bit of the thyroid gland in case there's hyperactivity, hyperactive thyroid gland and that can solve solve the problem. Today that is not done that often and they're more likely to do surgery to remove part of a thyroid gland if it is producing too much hormone. Now, of course, iodine deficiency in goiter can be very disturbing to, you know, to experience and also to to look at it's incredible how large the thyroid gland can can grow. And this is very rare now in North America, but in the developing world, you do see this where the diet is mostly rice, which doesn't contain any iodine and other grains which don't have any iodine. And so you do see this and it's remarkable because you need really so little iodine in in the diet. As you can see, we're talking about micrograms. Remember that with calcium, magnesium, we were talking milligrams, you know, 1000 milligrams, 1200 milligrams here we're talking about micrograms and yet there are deficiency. So once again, you want to know where you find iodine. You don't have to worry about it because it is really plentiful. And then the. Foods that the foods that. We eat as you can see, I mean just an egg will be enough. So we don't worry here. And also we, we get iodine in, in some unusual ways. You get it in milk. You know why? Because it is a standard method to wash the cows, others with an iodine solution to make sure that there are no bacteria growing There's that can get into the, into the milk. So some iodine does get into the milk, which is, is good for us. So we we get enough. It wasn't always the case. Back in the 1920s, there used to be what was called the goiter belt in the US, where people were living mostly on corn, eating no seafood at all, and not getting enough, and people were developing goiter. This no longer happens because of a simple intervention, and that is by putting iodine into salt, because salt of course, is widely used and you don't have to put very much iodine in there. You'll notice also, if you look at the label of your salt that there's dextrose in there. Why on earth would they be putting dextrose, which is just another term from glucose, into your salt? Well there actually is a reason for that because it protects the iodine, the iodide from reacting with oxygen of the air and being converted into elemental iodine that would vaporize out. So the sugar actually protects the potassium iodide that is put into the into the salt. Now not not every salt has iodine added. Sea salt has no iodine added as Himalayan pink salt has no iodine. Kosher salt has no iodine. Kosher salt, incidentally, has nothing to do with the salt being blessed in any way. It is just salt that is used to remove blood from from meat because when you have when you rub the meat with with salt, the blood will lose out. That's part of a cashew, but there's no blessing that's involved in some parts of the world today we still see deficiency, but not in not in North America. There's that one pocket there somewhere in South America and I don't know why that that is. But anyway, we don't worry here except in the case of of pregnancy there. You want to make sure that there's enough iodine in the diet, but generally pregnant women will be given a prenatal vitamin and that will include iodine. And this would be especially important in the case of vegans, you know, who who might possibly have deficiency, but you don't want too much. You know, this is again, one situation where more iodine is is not better. And the recommendation, as you can see, is not to exceed 500 micrograms with and 500 micrograms is way, way more than what you need anyway. But interesting enough, some of the stuff that you buy in the store, like, you know, scalp kelp is a kind of of seaweed that has more than what is recommended. I don't think that it's dangerous. But then you have some that have ridiculous amounts. And yeah, I've spoken to you before about Joe Mercola, who I think is, you know, one of the biggest disinformants out there. And this certainly is disinformation. I mean, that's, it's ridiculous to be recommending iodine supplements, you know, 1500 micrograms. Now just to get back for a moment to the radioactivity business, when you have a nuclear accident, radioactive potassium iodide gets released. It gets into the air. And of course, if it gets into people's body through inhalation, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland and it will cause thyroid cancer. And the idea is to protect people in case of a nuclear accident by giving them potassium iodide tablets so that non radioactive iodide will saturate the thyroid gland so it will have no need to pick up any extra iodine. And this became a big story when we had the Chernobyl accident way back in in 1986, which was the worst ever nuclear accident. It was in Ukraine when a nuclear power plant had what we call a meltdown, and radioactive material was released. And it resulted in a lot of thyroid cancers. And even though potassium iodide was distributed, it was too late. Why? Because, you know, at that time, the Ukraine was still part of Russia. And of course, the Russians would never admit that something like this happened. So for they were totally denying that there had been an accident. And in the meantime, the clouds of radioactive iodide was spreading and getting into people and there were thousands of cases of of cancer. Yeah, you go have to yell because it's impossible to hear how it's produced. Well, it's it's produced the in the nuclear reaction itself, right. Whenever you need to control the, the reaction, you, you have what you call these control rods, which are made of boron that absorbs the neutrons, that stops the reaction. But when those neutrons hit the the the boron, they produce iodide and that's radioactive at that point. So there's always the possibility in an accident of, of releasing radioactive iodide. Believe it or not, though, nuclear production of energy is probably the safest production of energy. When you think of coal mining and the thousands and thousands of people who have died, you know, over the years from coal mining. When you think of all the accidents with oil, oil refinery accidents, and then you may remember the Gulf of Mexico disaster, you know, when oil platform burst into and into flame. I mean, those are much more dangerous ways of producing energy than than nuclear. It's just that nuclear frightens people. But you know, I mean, really, Chernobyl was the only major nuclear accident we ever had. The Three Mile Island accident you may have heard about in the US was also a partial meltdown, but nothing ever escaped. So in in the future, nuclear is going to be the answer because we are going to run out of petroleum. This is for sure right? The earth is of a finite size. There's a set amount of petroleum. Petroleum is no longer be being made. Dinosaurs are no longer dying, right? So we will. Run out of petroleum. In the long run, nuclear has to be the the answer all right down to the 4th. And the last mineral we're going to talk about is iron. You find it in the middle of the periodic table and there are several different forms of, of iron. There of course, is elemental iron, which looks like a piece of iron. I mean, you, you can all picture that. But the ionic forms of iron, there are two, there are ferrous iron and ferric iron. OK. And in the in the first one, the elemental iron has lost two electrons. In the ferric iron, it has lost three electrons. And their behaviour is quite different, as you will see. Who is it that made the eating of iron famous? Cartoon character Popeye. Popeye the Sailor man, right? According to the cartoon, his strength came from eating his spinach. Eating his spinach, right? Well, spinach does contain iron, and iron deficiency does indeed lead to weakness because iron is critical in the formation of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen around the system. So the idea was that spinach contains iron and if you have a deficiency of iron, you're going to be weak and therefore eating iron makes you stronger. And Popeye became kind of the spokesperson for, you know, muscle growth and being strong, etcetera. Now there are several issues here. 1 issue is that ferric iron, iron, which is what you find in spinach, is not easily absorbed by the body. Remember that we discussed that just the presence of a mineral doesn't mean that is easily absorbed because it depends on how that mineral is bound up in in the food. So ferric iron is not easily absorbed, but ferrous iron are also called heme iron because that's the way that is present in red meat and we are red meat, right. So that's the form that it is present in our our body as well. Now there is an analogy here to chlorophyll because the hemoglobin molecule is in fact similar to chlorophyll, except instead of having the magnesium iron in the centre, we have an iron, iron in in in the centre and it is to dot atom of iron that oxygen binds. Now the rest of the hemoglobin molecule, as you can see it's pretty complicated because there are proteins attached to the central molecule. So it's a very complex molecule, but it is what carries oxygen around the system and it is what is formed in your bone marrow where your red blood cells form. And your red blood cells live for about 3 months and they have to be constantly synthesized in the bone marrow. So of course you need a constant intake of of iron. So hemoglobin is important in oxygen transport. Obviously that requires the formation of red blood cells. It is also needed for myoglobin. Myoglobin is the substance that muscles are made of. It's very similar to hemoglobin. It is important, as you can see, for immune function, hormone production. Also it's a coenzyme and it is one of the more common deficiencies they will do. Generally in a routine blood test, they will do a test for iron, although the test that they do is actually for ferritin and this is an iron storage protein. This is how the body, when you absorb iron from food into your bloodstream, it is then absorbed by this protein and you get this ferritin, which is really a storage form of iron. It will release iron as is needed and it will absorb iron if there's too much of it. So this is a very good test for whether or not you have the right level of iron in in your blood. And when the body signals as you can see that you need more iron and should it not be coming in from the diet, then ferritin will release some. If there's too much iron in your blood, it will try to absorb it, right. So obviously iron is, is very important. And if you are deficient in iron, you have a condition called anemia. You don't have enough red blood cells, so there's not enough oxygen being carried around the body, which of course will have a number of symptoms. Obviously, feeling tired all the time, which is usually what alerts a doctor to look to see whether you're anemic, but of course, most people feel tired all the time anyway and which can be due to many, many other reasons. But nevertheless, it it needs to be checked out. As you can see, it can have sleep disturbances and unfortunately all of these symptoms that we talk about can also be symptoms of many different diseases. So it's often hard to you know, figure out that's what is what is happening. But why would you be iron deficient? Well, there are several reasons. One of course is blood loss of some kind. I mean, obviously if you have some severe injury where you have lost blood, that that is 11 situation if you don't eat any red meat at all, if you have some sort of intestinal disease like once again, colitis or Crohn's where it doesn't get absorbed through the intestine. So these are all, you know, possibilities and, and you know, it's, it's, it's not rare, but one of the things to look for if you're iron deficient and there's no other reason to explain it, is whether or not there's some bleeding going on in the body. And that can happen in the gastrointestinal tract. So very often a colon cancer. Is picked up by a blood test where you where it shows that you have blood in in in the stool, which just means that it is being released from the body so that you're iron deficient. So you always look for. Some sort of gastric cancer if you are anemic and there's no other explanation that has been found. Now, believe it or not, the treatment of anemia, especially if the major symptom is energy deficiency, has also been known since antiquity. If you know the story of Jason and the Argonauts, the old Greek myth, they used shavings from their sword and swallowed that to give them more energy. How they ever thought of that, who knows. But in the 18th century there was an actual treatment for what they called weakness, which today we recognize as anemia. Nails were put into an apple, and then you would eat the apple after you've taken out the nails, right? Why? Because an apple is acidic, and enough of the iron would dissolve in the apple to basically make the apple into an iron supplement. So what seemed like a silly treatment actually works. So once again, we look at iron. The amount that we need is in the milligram level 20 milligram, we're talking the ballpark figure. This is not, not very difficult to get in the diet. As you can see, a lot of our flour is enriched with iron. So the pasta that you eat will will have it, beans, lentils, pretty rich in iron, but of course red meat. If you eat red meat, you you don't have to worry about getting enough iron and even vegans really don't have to worry much because as you can see, the to to get 1520 grams is not it's not that difficult. Now this myth with spinach as being a good source of iron, it is a myth because in spinach, the iron is tied up. It's tied up just like we said before, with with with calcium. The oxalates will tie up the the iron. So the truth is that spinach, in fact, is not a good source of iron. Even though when you do a chemical assay you will fire find iron there. I mean in comparison to meat, as you can see it's insignificant. You can increase your intake of non heme iron, which is what you find in plant sources like like in spinach by combining it with vitamin C Vitamin C will help in the absorption of of iron and that's why in some iron supplements you have a relatively small amount of iron. If you look at the first one, there's there's 28 milligrams, but if you look at the the label, you see that it also contains vitamin C. So it means that a great deal of of that 28 milligrams is actually going to be absorbed. Nobody should be taking an iron supplement just because you think that you you're feeling tired, OK, because you can overdose on iron, as you'll see in a minute. But it should only be taken if you've had a blood test and they've recommended that you take an iron supplement. But again, it's unlikely because we fortify flour with with iron and of course you eat bread, so that will have iron in it. It's also used to fortify many cereals, sometimes in an interesting way, using metallic iron. Cheerios actually has bits of iron in there. Now how come we're using iron and not a compound of iron? Because your stomach contains hydrochloric acid, and iron will react with hydrochloric acid to make ferric chloride, and that ionic form will then be absorbed into the bloodstream. You can do this little experiment at home with your Cheerios. Take a magnet, take the Cheerios, grind it up, put the magnet in there. You'll be surprised. When you take out the magnet, it will be coated with iron. OK, that's what you're eating, but it's fine because of the gets. Converted in the body into absorbable iron. And of course, it's a very cheap way of fortifying the the food now. Interestingly enough, modern technology has also resulted in reducing our natural iron intake. Why? Because cooking in cast iron used to be common. That was the main cooking utensil. Now we're cooking in stainless steel. Well, cast iron very easily will give up its iron to whatever vegetable that you're cooking in it. Stainless steel is inert, right? So we're getting less iron from there. But again, very unlikely that your iron deficiency, but it really the only way to know that is to do a blood test. Now finally, there is the other side of the coin with iron. There is something known as iron overload disease. This is called hemochromatosis. It's a pretty rare disease. It generally is due to malfunctioning liver cirrhosis of the liver. It in theory could be due to to taking in too much iron, but that that would be extremely rare. However, hemochromatosis is is a serious condition because iron also catalyzes all kinds of oxidation reactions in the body that lead to the formation of free radicals, which can cause cancer. So someone who has been diagnosed with hemochromatosis of course requires attention. And this can be done by, of course, watching your iron intake and, you know, avoiding vitamin C, which enhances the influx of iron. But the classic treatment, which is still used today for hemochromatosis is phlebotomy, just removing blood because that's where your iron is, right. And so that is really the standard treatment. Now finally, this whole business of, you know, eating iron for energy, Yeah, there is some substance to that. If you are anemic, you will be tired. And then if you ingest iron, it will treat the anemia and you will feel more energetic. The only thing is that that you have to investigate why you're anemic. So, you know, just discovering that that you're anemic and starting to take iron supplements, you'll feel better. But why are you anemic? That's the question. And unfortunately, the answer to that question very often is that you're bleeding from somewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. So we started with the story of Popeye claiming that his strength came from eating spinach, which was interpreted by the public as because spinach contains iron, because everyone knew that, you know, you need iron for strength. Well, what did Popeye actually say? Yeah, He said there's nothing like spinach to give a man's strength. He never claimed it was because of iron in the spinach. In fact, if you look at the original cartoon, this is it. Spinach is full of vitamin A, and that's what makes a human strong and healthy. So the argument for spinach is wrong on two kinds. 2 counts. It will not give you strength and Popeye never claimed that it was iron in in the spinach. So Popeye eating spinach for strength, This is a total myth. I'm not against spinach, it's a certainly a good food and it does have a number of of of nutrients. But this is not what you need to. Give you strength. All right. For finally there's one last question here. I mean we talked about calcium and magnesium, iodine and iron and about deficiencies. And, and I think you saw from calcium and magnesium and the iron stories that it is possible to not have enough in the diet, less likely for iron, but calcium and magnesium, it's, it's possible. Then there are all of the other minerals that we don't really have time to, to talk about that you need in very little doses possible that we don't get enough. So therefore, you know, there is this question, is it worthwhile to take one of these multivitamin, multi mineral supplements, sort of as can I say nutritional insurance, you know, to fill in gaps. In case you think that you don't have a a proper diet, it's hard to say because you would really have to do the the classic experiment where you would have two groups of. People you know, and you would one group would be supplemented with with vitamin and the other not and you'd have to follow them for decades to see what the outcome is. It's very, very difficult to do. On the other hand, these multi vitamin multi mineral supplements are very cheap. You know it's it's a couple of pennies a day and they are harmless. They may do some good, though it's hard to know whether to, you know, recommend it or not. But I would say that, you know, if you have questions about whether or not you really do have a balanced diet, which I think the fact is that many people your age don't you eat, you know, too much pizza or. You. Know too much spaghetti or whatever? Not enough vegetables? There's no harm in taking a multivitamin tablet. But it's not going to perform miraculously, you know, as some of the advertisers say. But. You know it's the. Not a bad idea, sort of nutritional insurance. Of course, the better idea is to make sure that you have a proper, proper diet. All right, So this is up to where you're responsible for for the. Exam and there's one article that is now on my courses. It's a relatively short article for you to read. It's about one of the vitamins that we didn't cover here. Biotin and read it, study it, OK? So quick question about. Calcium about calcium. So I know that our current practice among farmers is to spread calcium and carbonate on their fields in order to reduce soil acidity. And that's can that calcium also make its way into so attention. So if if crop doesn't have that, let's say, let's say a farmer's really low on the other soil. Miriam, I have a movie. For you, Actually, I was reading this book, which was so captivating that I couldn't. I was. Listening to actually talking about. Sometimes we have to sit in the garage. Yeah, it's. And now there's a movie. It's called The House. I've watched it and I've read it. I'm yes, it's very, very, very, very. So that's what I listen to myself. And the movie. You saw the movie really good. I know I watched it with my friend. I forced them to come with me and they were like, why don't you? Do they like the actress? She's a very good reputation, but I made them much for. Me and they loved it. They changed the image, maybe for the better, I'm not sure. Otherwise, it was very true to the book, except. That the Italian. Gardener didn't have a special role in the movie. And also Nina was a bit too tricky because in the book it's a, you know, she's been chubby and. But it was really it. Was really well filmed. I the only thing people were like complaining about was the I think people were like, it was. Too. Too pretty of an actually, because you were like the I think in the movie. It was like for me when I imagined when I read the book was like, like Harry Potter vibes. Agree. Dark stuff. It was a really pretty opposite. You were like. Other than that, yeah, it was very true. Like. The house exactly like you imagined it and the. Room where she was locked in exactly like you imagined it. So I think you know, they, I think they did a good job. I mean the the ending. Of course they made it. More brutal. Brutal it was. It was also friendly because when? Before the books, I read the books. It was like, I'm going to be surprised. And that was a queen. What's happening right now? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I. Saw you mentioned Himalayan pink salt in your lap. Yes. Well, I'm quite interested in it because it's named after Himalayan. Yeah, and it's. Well, that's where you find it. Triple expensier than the table salt, right? For no reason so. Is it gutters? It's. Nothing. I mean, the only thing you get is a bit of color from the small amount of and. It's pretty minerals that are prettier. Yeah. Oh, we don't, I mean that much minerals. No, it's a purely, it is purely a marketing gimmick. And I saw on the social media the horse leak on it. That what? The the Himalayan. King, Yeah. The leak on it. And it's expensive. Yeah. I mean, it's yeah, there's no reason to buy. It. Take your lecture. Well, actually I wanted to learn magic from you is. It possible? Like the fire boom boom and. Well, yeah, I mean they the fire you, you can actually can buy. It's called Flash. Paper. We can make it too, but. Oh, I thought you deep in some chemical. Yes, solution. I mean, yes, I mean you can make it. It you you take paper and you treat it with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. It's it's I would not recommend it. It's a dangerous reaction to you. Yeah, well, rather. Rope the rope. The rope you can buy. OK, I can tell you where to buy it, can buy it on Amazon, OK. Have it. Good night. OK, I have a. Small question, it's like, I know I maybe should go ask a nutritionist, but and we're seeing in the next class, I know it's about additives and like because I eat cereal in the morning and I'm actively eating raising, which like they I like it because it has high protein, high fiber and etcetera. But it like has a lot of sugar And I use this app because I basically it tells me kind of goods are and foods are and it always randoms that is higher than like for example 5 or one or Cheerios or others because they have additives. So is it like honestly still if additives are that bad that I should just keep eating Raisin Gran? Because, well, look, my sugar, what sugar? What you have to look at is, is not individual foods, but how much you're eating during the day. I mean, if, if you're under 90 grams of sugar a day, you're fine. It doesn't matter where it comes from, you know, And if you're over 90 grams, yeah, no, don't be. OK. That was. Just but like why it ran so high? Even so, it had so much sugar. To make it taste good so that you keep buying it. Yeah, no, but why rent? Like so like it's not healthy per SE, but like health, it says it's healthier than. Like, well, because of like brand high fiber, but but brand doesn't taste so good. So you've got to put in sugar. Thank you. You mentioned GOP, I was just wondering what your thoughts were like Things like for example, like what? Well, peptide is a complicated story. First of all, peptide is not one thing. Peptide is a class of molars, right? You can have short peptides, long peptides. The amino acid composition will determine what it is. The the peptide that you probably hear in the world now is, is the BC 157 for strength. OK, all of the evidence for that is an animal stone. Animal stone. There is no human clinical. Trial for that that shows anything. It's a long way from animal to to human. Now there's no big risk in consuming peptides because they're just amino acids. Which, you know, that's what proteins are. Are made of but this the strengthening peptides that everyone is talking about and James James they're taking the BC 157 there there's just no human clinical trial. So there's a lot of anecdotal evidence, you know, and I mean, I've seen some, you know, theoretical papers on plausibility, but you know, but I, I, I, I could never recommend something until there's a human child. But on the other hand, I don't think there's a danger. I'm just curious. And, and also, I mean, it's, it is not going to make you grow muscle. What it might do is if you do the same amount of of exercise, the same weightlifting, you might recover faster so that you can do more repetitions. That's what would build the muscle. That's possible, but just consuming it is not going to do anything. OK all. Right, thank you. So I. Think we've been talking about more Co porosis in terms of aging women and how their estrogen levels go down. So that I think you said it doesn't have a vitamin D production, which like goes with calcium. Yeah. But so how does that like what, what hormone is it just like testosterone of men that makes it so that vitamin D kind of? Men have to. Men have estrogen too. Yeah, yeah. But it's just that you don't lose it because we don't have no menopause. So you have constant level. Yeah, this is a general question. So you're talking about sleep and stuff like that and only a couple like past few days, obviously I'm going to sleep for some reason, like randomly, I haven't really much. So obviously I know you can't die in just anything. Do you have any like for example, like a a glass of milk before I sleep like that you know meant? Well, all I can tell you is anecdotal evidence because I have a lot of trouble sleeping. Yeah. No matter what I do, I wake up at about 4:30. So I've tried everything. I've tried the melatonin. I've tried glycine. I've tried the magnesium. None of those. None of those work. But you know, I speak to some people who will swear by melatonin. Yeah, fair enough, but melatonin occurs naturally in like some things like. Oats or lots of warm milk. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they're, you know, I mean, if you really have sleep deprivation for a long time, there are pharmaceutical products. Yeah. But, you know, you don't, you don't want to do that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like I I said, I I've not had luck with magnesium, but I know a lot of people who have and. Do you think that might be placebo effect? Maybe, but does it matter? Yeah, I guess. Yeah, really. But. Yeah. And and, you know, I mean, there's absolutely no harm in trying 250 milligrams of magnesium at night. Yeah. Yeah, exactly, 'cause it's yeah, it's not going to kill you. Yeah, same with the multivitamins and minerals. Yeah, my dad takes them all the time. And like I tell him, like, do you really need all that? By Yeah, well, I mean, chances are, you know here that if you have any kind of a decent diet, you don't need it. But I think that, you know, there are a lot of people in North America who don't have a decent diet, starting from Trump. I I agree, but I feel like with the dining hall, like you said, I think they designed it in a way that it has everything. That oh which? Where are you? Which line? Upper Bishop Mountain Hall. Yeah, I, I don't know there, but I know Royal Victoria is actually excellent. I've I've gone there for lunch a few times. I actually really like it, but they have, I feel like they have a good spread of things. They do if. You want it to be unhealthy, you can make it unhealthy, but yeah, if you. Have. Oh yeah, yeah. No, I, I, yeah, I, I think and. In the residences you can eat well and, and I mean, you know, they there are nutritionists who have designed what what they should serve, but obviously you also have to take cost into that kind. Of yeah. And you also have to take into account what students are willing to eat and what not. Yeah, just a bunch of brushed sprouts and that's it. A lot of and. You know, I mean, we've spoken about, you know, providing more broccoli and it was stride stays there, you know? No, I found that too. I'm like, I don't really see much about like which I don't care about, but it's something I've noticed. I thought, oh, they might have like, you know, more like broccoli and stuff like that. But you, I really find that. So I guess that is the reason. For it but. Well, yeah, we did an experiment once where? I put 2 buckets. Out in front of my office, 1 full of apples and one full of Donuts. By the time that the Donuts disappeared, 1 apple. You can lead them to water, but you can't make them drink. Yeah. All right. Thank you. See ya. Yeah.
