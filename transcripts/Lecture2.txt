I'm so happy to be OK. Thank you. What's your story today? The. None. Yeah. As I told you last time, I do not assume that you have any prior knowledge of chemistry, but I do assume that you can all read. None. None. We're not going to start until everyone abides by by that. OK. Thank you. That is not just some silly whim. It is because we do have camera coverage of the room, but not of those sections. All right, how many of you here for the first time? OK. Obviously you will have to look at the lecture from last time because it is covered on the exam and you will have to take a look at my courses because everything that you need to know really is is there all the details about the exam and recordings etcetera are are all there. OK, so I don't need to go over any of of that. There's just one other thing that I'll I'll mention is that as you know, this is very large class and I often get questions about writing letters of reference because many of you are going on to grad school or to whatever. I obviously cannot do that unless I know you. So if anybody has that kind of intention that you think that you will need a letter of reference, then drop by my office so we can have a little chat so that I can get to to know you. All right. With that being said, we're going to get going. And one of the most frequently used adages in the area of nutrition is that you are what you eat, right? And I'm sure that you've heard this many, many times. And the question is, what do we really make of this? How important is this? Well, interestingly enough, there have been numerous pictorial representations of this over the years. You know, very, very cleverly done. These are some of the current ones, but there are others that have, you know, more historical interest. But as you can see, they're very ingenious little drawings. And of course, the overall suggestion is that that we are literally made of the food that that we we eat. And by and large, of course, that is true. As I told you last time, since food is the only raw material that ever goes into our body except for water and the air that we inhale, obviously we are constructed of the components of food which our body reorganizes obviously into the components that that it needs. There are many such representations and I used this one once in a, in a talk to to physicians actually. And I got some Flack for that because they claim that it kind of implied that if someone is overweight, it is because they're eating the wrong foods. Well, overweight, as you will see, because we will talk about that in detail. Is is a is a problem? It is a physiological problem. But it is also true that the laws of thermodynamics will never be rescinded and the only way to lose weight is to spend more calories than you take in. Now there are nuances to that argument, as as we will see, but I don't think it is totally wrong to have a representation that if you eat the wrong kinds of foods, you are more likely to to be overweight anyway. More of that that to come. But this idea that you are what you eat is all around us. There are numerous scientific papers published using that that title. And if you go on Amazon and search for books, you will see a whole array of books that have the title You are what you eat or subtitle or whatever. So this is a very, very common kind of lingo in the world of of of nutrition. The first time that anyone kind of formalized this idea was Brias Savant, who was a French philosopher and gourmand way, way back, you know, a couple, 100 years ago. And he became famous for a book that he wrote. And this was a book that was entitled The Physiology of Taste, but it it really was sort of a a compendium of nutritional information as was available at that time. And his classic statement was tell me what you eat and I will tell you who you are. So this was really the first sort of formal statement about you are what you eat, except that he really didn't mean it the way that it is very often interpreted by, you know, modern nutritionists. This was more of a a social comment in the sense that poor people ate differently from people who were of course well off. So I said I ask everyone not to sit in the anywhere on the side or anywhere behind the path at the back. So please, those of you sitting there, move down. So what? He suggested that, you know, if you knew someone's diet, you, you right away knew what kind of social class they were in. Poor people ate very simple diets of, you know, bread and water. And more affluent people, of course, had much, much greater choice. But the book was also interesting in the sense that it did approach nutrition as it was, you know, known in those days. And Bria Savarin actually suggested that sugar and white flour were unhealthy and were basically one of the reasons that people became overweight. It was somewhat overly simplistic, but nevertheless, there, you know, there was some wisdom there. Now, the interesting question to ask is when did we really start to get advice about nutrition from people who really knew something about nutrition? And you may be surprised that it is relatively recent. I mean, we go back, as you can see, to 1894, just not that long ago. And this was really an epic manuscript written by William Olin Atwater, who was a professor of of chemistry, but who did do a great deal of work with the Department of Agriculture. As, as, as you can see, well, here is Atwater and you can see him at the top. He was a chemistry professor at Wesleyan University. And he published this document, which was the first time that anyone had really given formal advice to people about what to eat. It was rather simplistic. He said Americans should eat less sugar and fewer fats. Well, you know, that was pretty clever. We, of course, still say that. He also related the amount of energy that you need to take in to the amount of energy that you expend, so that people who did a lot of physical labour had to have a higher caloric intake. And he also was in favour of milk as as a food, although he was not keen on fruits and vegetables. Of course, this was before anything was known about the vitamins or mineral content of of food. He was not keen on these because he didn't think that they delivered enough calories in terms of what, what they cost. So, you know, we had some interesting ideas there, but but it was rather primitive in terms of what we, what we know today. The next sort of step that that was taken was in 1922 in an ad, believe it or not, an ad by Fleischmann's, by Fleischmann's yeast, which was a, a commercial product in, in, in those days. And you can see that there is the philosophy there that you are what you eat. O They were very much aware of this. And the Fleischmann was, and this ad talked about how people should be eating healthier food, which of course yeast was supposedly one, and also mentioned the importance of, of avoiding what we today we would call highly processed foods. But you know, those days they talked about refined foods, whatever. But, you know, back in 1922, they were already recommending that we should be careful about what we eat in terms of, of of processing. Today, this of course, has blossomed. And you see this kind of of information everywhere all the time about what we should be staying away from. And we will talk about that in, in, in, in detail. But the the first time that the actual sentence you are what you eat was visible to the public, believe it or not, was in an ad by the United Meat Marketers and they quoted a self ordained nutritionist by the name of Victor Lindlar. And he directly stated, as you can see, you are what you eat. Lindlar even wrote a book entitled You Are What You Eat Now. He did not have any formal training in nutrition. He was actually a graduate of the College of Osteopathy in Chicago. Now, this was before osteopathic medicine became a legitimate branch of medicine, which it is in the US. In the US, you have medical schools that train osteopathic physicians, and they eventually go into the same match as as physicians trained in conventional medical schools. So there's really no distinction. But back in those days, osteopathy was a fringe profession, so Lindler really didn't have much background. Now, that doesn't mean that he did not have some good suggestions, which he did. Interestingly enough, he suggested that people should be using a product called Serutan, which had a very interesting name. Can anyone guess why the manufacturer came up with this name, which seems like just some nonsensical word? Yes, sorry. Because when it says, when it's read backwards, yes, if you read it backwards, it says natures. And of course it was the implication that natural cures were to be sought after, that they were better than synthetic substances. That's a philosophy, of course, that is still with us today. Well, what was ceriutan? Ceriutan actually was an extract of the plant called plantagoovata. It was a, it's a complex carbohydrate, It is a form of fibre. It is no longer sold under that name, but you are probably familiar with Metamucil that is exactly the same thing sold under another name and it is very beneficial in terms of fiber. And again, we will have occasion to talk in detail about this, but fiber is a component of food that are digestive enzymes, cannot break down and which goes through the stomach, goes through the small intestine into the colon where bacteria are able to digest it and in some cases produce some very useful compounds like butyric acid as a byproduct of their metabolisms. Anyway, we will talk about this, but it's interesting that way back then he had the idea that fiber was a healthy thing. It also should be stated though, that that hygiene in those days in the food industry is not what we would like to see today and there was not a great deal of attention paid to it. There were a lot of illnesses caused by bacterial contamination of food. Simple things like like workers not washing their hands after they went to the bathroom and they would handle the food. Also, food processing was entering the picture and Lindlar railed against that because he thought people should be eating fresh foods. Well, the first food process that was popular were was cereals. Kellogg's cornflakes was available in the early 1900s and Lindlar thought that this was not nutritious food and he in the case of cornflakes, he was basically right. So here was someone who really didn't have a background, proper background in nutrition, and yet he was giving people advice and some of it was right because he urged them to eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. He also urged them to stay away from the processed foods of the era, which are already were available. Things like hot dogs and Nathan's hot dogs, one of the most famous ones, as you can see in those days, it cost $0.05. But you always have to be careful about, you know, these cost comparisons in, in terms of different eras, because you also have to take a look at what salaries were. So, you know, $0.05 in those days is not what $0.05 is, is today. Your, your weekly salary may have been $20.00. So he got some things right. But in his book, you are what you eat. He also suggested that food was cure for virtually any disease. And if you look through those, you'll see that that he thought that, you know, food was essentially a panacea cure for everything, which it is not. Nutrition is important, but it you can't cure every disease by what you eat. We keep trying though, because of course there are numerous publications that come out all the time, and many of these are in the vein of you are what you eat. Here's a recent one with the conclusion being very clear that the more fruits and vegetables we eat, the better off we are. Now, of course, nutritional advice hit the headlines last week with the major announcement in the US of the new guidelines for Americans. And this was a major announcement by Kennedy, who is the US Secretary of Health. And I told you last time my views on this gentleman, I think it is absolutely ridiculous that he should be in the position that he is in. He has zero science background, which does not keep him from pontificating on issues as complex as vaccination and nutrition. In any case, they did come out with the guidelines, which were not quite as bad as I thought that they would be because at least he did not urge people to drink raw milk, which privately he does. But this was not part of the of the guidelines. But there there are some issues here. Here are the basic points that were put forward. The first thing was to make sure that you eat protein at every meal, which is not a bad idea, but neither it is a requirement. You can have a very good diet without eating protein at at every every meal. The recommendation to eat full fat dairy product is a little bit curious because we have a lot of accumulated evidence about saturated fats, which is what you find in full fat dairy product being detrimental to, to, to health. And also the suggestion to incorporate what he called healthy fats from meat. Enter a diet. I mean, that doesn't really play well in terms of what we know about nutrition that overindulgence in meat is, is not, not a good idea. But again, it, you know, it's, it's, it's not horrific. Although if you look at the bottom say limit alcohol, but what does that mean limit alcohol? I mean to to one person that might mean one drink a day, to someone else it might mean 2 drinks a day. So this is is not a scientific statement. There should be some numbers attached to it. I think the goal based on what we know about science should be 0. You should endeavour to drink no alcohol. Of course, life doesn't work like that because there are situations, social situations where of course it's fun to indulge now and then. But really the goal should be to, to minimise alcohol as as much as you can. Now when they publish these dietary guidelines, it came with this inverted pyramid. And here there's a lot to to criticize. How do you interpret this? Well, first of all, I think what sticks out that you right away is that giant RIP steak and that that whole Turkey at the top, which means that this should be the the biggest source of protein. This should be the, the basis. I mean, it encourages eating meat and next to it is whole fat milk product. So I can tell you that the dairy industry and the beef industry were very happy with with this. And it's also interesting that of the 10 member committee that came up with these guidelines, 5 had financial interests in the beef industry and in the in the dairy industry. Also, something that is really very curious here is that they did maintain a guideline from the previous guidelines and that was to reduce your fat intake, your saturated fat intake to the extent that it is no more than 10% of your total calories. That is totally incompatible with that food pyramid that they have. You cannot have a diet that is based on on meat and Turkey and full fat dairy products and have less than 10% of your calories coming from fat. So these new guidelines really are a mix of of sense and nonsense, but it's not quite as bad as it it could have been because they also did really emphasize the importance to curb the intake of highly processed foods. Now, there are many nuances of course, due to what we should eat. One being that that we are all biochemically individual and different people can consume exactly the same diet and have different outcomes, not only in terms of of body mass, but also in terms of health outcomes. Because the body's an extremely complicated machine and our bodies do not all work exactly the same way for many reasons. One, of course is genetics. Genetics play a very important role in everything that happens in our body. We also know about the importance of activity. Sedentary behaviour is not conducive to good health. I mean, we know all the benefits of of exercise. So you may eat quote right according to all the guidelines, but if you don't do any exercise, the results are not going to be very good. Then we are exposed in our life, of course, to all kinds of substances, so-called toxic substances. And indeed, I mean, we're exposed to thousands and thousands of different chemicals of all kind and they have an impact on our body. And obviously this is distinct from nutrition, but it can affect our our health. I mean, virtually every day we have some new article coming out about some new pollutant in the environment, in this particular case the perfluoroalkyl substances which get into our environment from plastics and other materials, and they can have hormonal effects and all of these influence our health. And then of course, there are also the microbes which inhabit our body, inside our body. And on the surface of our our body, there are trillions of bacteria. And it used to be believed that they're just sort of innocent bystanders. And if they do anything at all, they cause disease. Well, today we know that that is not the case. They're not just bystanders. They actually interact with the body, sometimes in a beneficial way. So life is complicated. Nutrition, of course, is is one part of health, but there are many other factors. I mean, if you smoke, if you drink, if you abuse drugs, or if you just ride your bicycle without a helmet, you're taking a risk, right? These are all risks in, in, in, in life. Bad diet is just one of these risks. But there's something else that we should mention before we really, you know, delve deeply into, into nutrition. Yeah. And that is that there's more to life than worrying about every morsel of food that goes into your mouth and every drop of, of, of beverage that that you you consume. Food is also a great source of pleasure in life. And it's stressful to constantly worry about whether or not you're eating right. Yes, obviously we should all be making a major effort based on the science that that we know, but there's no need to become neurotic about, you know, and worry about every bite that that that you you take. In fact, our our friend Rial Savoran, who we met earlier, said that the discovery of a new dish does more for the happiness of mankind than the discovery of of a star. And there is something to that. Food is a great source of pleasure. Unfortunately for some people too great a a source. But let's not demonize food even with ultra processed foods. I mean eating one chip is not going to kill you, neither is 2 chips, but you don't want to eat a bag of chips every day. So all within reason. But of course the within reason depends on the science that we know. And that is really what we need to explore. What do we really know? How do we really come to make judgements? Well, our body of course is a machine and like any machine, it requires a source of energy. No matter what we do. Whether you are running, whether you are just thinking, that requires energy, believe it or not, the brain functioning requires energy. Glucose is the main source of energy for the brain. A very appropriate analogy would be a car, right? You got to fuel your car, whether it's by gasoline or more likely these days, by electricity. Your car will run, but it is not a perpetual motion machine. It will not run forever. Eventually you run out of gas, you run out of electricity and it stops. The same thing goes for the human body. We need a constant supply of energy which comes from food. How is it then that we have someone like this lady in Ethiopia, Bulwark and Bob, who claims that she has not eaten any food for 16 years? But this of course makes for a rather intriguing story. It is not possible in terms of what we we know we need energy. Now it is true, as Einstein stated, that energy can be changed from one form to the other, but you cannot create it out of nothing. So what on earth is going on here with this lady? Well, in order to to understand this, we have to delve a little bit into the Physiology of, of, of food and how indeed it provides energy. The main source of energy for our body is glucose and glucose in our body combines with oxygen. And of course we have to inhale oxygen. This is necessity for life for this particular reaction because glucose, it requires oxygen to react with in order to generate a molecule called ATP. It doesn't adenosine triphosphate, which is the body's currency of of energy. So when you have this reaction under way, you produce some carbon dioxide, of course, which we exhale. You also produce some water, and you produce the energy to produce this molecule in the body. This is the molecule that in turn provides energy by decomposing. Adolescent triphosphate, as the name implies, has three phosphate groups attached to it. When one of those phosphate groups breaks down and engages in reactions to react elsewhere, we have the release of energy. Now this is is pretty complicated system and a lot of people are curious about how it is that breaking a chemical bond can result in release of energy. Because we know that to break a bond you have to put in energy well, but when you form bonds you release energy. So although it takes energy to break that phosphate away from the ATP, the reactions that that liberated phosphate then engages in all the bond formation releases more energy than was required. So there's a net release of energy. This is the energy that we need to run all of the chemical reactions in our body, which collectively are called metabolism. Now metabolism is a term that is bandied about all the time and it's confusing to to many people. What it really means is the energy that is needed to run all of the chemical reactions that constitute life and there are thousands and thousands of these reactions that are going on in our body all the time. They have to be fuelled and this is collectively referred to as metabolism. The body, however, needs something else other than food in order to function, and that is water, because all of these chemical reactions that we talk about in the body take place in solution, right? Our blood is really a solution, or plasma is really a solution. These are liquids, so all of the component chemicals have to dissolve and they have to dissolve in something. And water is the basis of all of the liquids in our body. Water is needed to flush everything out of our body, of course, in, in the form of of urine other than just serving as, as a solvent. And you know, our, our body is composed of about 60 to 70% the water. So obviously we do have to drink all the time. We can go a long time without food. People have gone 10 weeks and sometimes even longer without food, but you cannot go longer than three, 4-5 days without water. And yet if you read the Guinness Book of Records, which of course is a very interesting publication, they will tell you about this guy who went for 18 days without water. Why? Because he was locked in a in a jail cell and they forgot about him and only after 18 days did they realise that the cell was in the basement, that he had been locked in there. So it is true that he was not given any food or any any water. How could he have survived? Because it was cool there and on the cement walls moisture from the air condensed and he kept licking that. So he was not without water for for 18 days. Now about this business of food. How long can you go without food? It is very interesting. And here we go back to 1965 and at that time the 27 year old Antonio Barbieri who weighed in at stunning 456 lbs. And he had tried everything and he eventually consulted physicians and they suggested a controlled fast in which he would be constantly under physician's care. And he went from 456 to 180 lbs, which is a very, very significant weight loss by essentially eating nothing. Very impressive. As you can see. Those are the pants he had before. He could have now fit three times in into this. The headlines everywhere on the tabloid said no food for 382 days. Well, that's a lot of days. We know that that people can go 10 weeks, 12 weeks without food, but that's still far away from 382 days. So how do we explain this? His case was actually written up in the medical journal, and I call your attention here to the yeast where they describe everything that he was given. He was obviously given liquids to drink, but also he was given yeast. We don't know exactly how much because it's not mentioned in in paper here, but yeast is a source of amino acids. It's also source of carbohydrates. So he did not literally go without any food at all for 382 days. Unfortunately, he did not live very long either. He died at the age of 51. And whether or not it was due to this dramatic fast, nobody really knows. So how long can someone really go without eating food? We know the answer to that question. We know it thanks to David Blaine, one of the most well known magicians today who went without food for 44 days. And there's no doubt about that. I'll show you why. Besides being a magician, he also likes to do things that have never been done before. I mean, he he is a glutton for fame. For example, he was encased in a cube of ice. In Times Square in New York for days. Again, this is real. I mean, you know, there were thousands of witnesses to this, but this business of going for over 40 days without food is well documented. How so? Because he was locked inside of a plexiglass cage supported by a crane above the Thames River in in London. This was back in in in 2000 and and three in full view of everyone. So had he cheated in any way and consumed food, of course people would have seen it. It was actually some somewhat of a comical atmosphere. People would throw tomatoes at him. People were hitting golf balls and there was one guy who had a model airplane, a remote control helicopter actually, with which he circled blame taunting him with a bag of McDonald's food. Anyway, he of course was able to drink water. You can't go that long without water. But it is absolutely documented that he did not eat any food whatsoever over this. He eventually quit after the 44 days when he had lost 54 lbs, which was very visible. He was not a beacon of health, as you can see. But he had proved the point, sillyly I think of that. You can't go that long without food. He was carted off to hospital. He, he literally couldn't walk after this and the whole sequence of events in the hospitals documented. We, we, we know the story there, there it is. He had to be very carefully refed. When someone is starved like that for so long, you can't just start, you know, loading him up with, with food. He actually suffered from something called hypophosphatemia. Phosphate is a very important biochemical. It's needed for many metabolic processes. It serves as an electrolyte in, in, in, in, in plasma and in, in in the bloodstream. Now, what happens when you go on a starvation diet like that? Your body stores of carbohydrate, which are the main source of energy are very quickly used up and then your body starts burning it stored fat and it stored protein as a source of energy. So that's why of course you lose your muscle and you lose your your fat. But it turns out that when you are burning fat and amino acids, the biochemistry is different than when your body is burning carbohydrates. You don't need phosphate as an electrolyte to burn protein and fat. So what happened here was that when they had to start refeeding him and of course you have to start giving food in the form of energy of of glucose, but glucose metabolism requires phosphate. But he didn't have any phosphate in his body because he hadn't eaten for so long. So he started to suffer from too little phosphate in the body, which can be a life threatening condition. So the refeeding had to be done very, very slowly and very carefully in order to make sure that they start giving him phosphate in appropriate amounts so that he can then start metabolizing the glucose that they were giving him. And it took weeks in the hospital until his body started to work properly. He just likes to do these bizarre things. One of the more recent ones was to hitch a ride with I think 72 helium balloons. And he went aloft with these balloons up to 23,000 feet. That is almost where airplanes fly. That's quite a height. Now, of course, he wasn't just holding on to those balloons with one hand. As you can see, he he was hitched to his belt that so he went up to 23,000 feet and then he parachuted safely back down. Why? Because no one else had ever done that. So that's the kind of thing that that he likes to do. Well, the point of this whole story is to get back to Our Lady who claims that she never eats and never drinks and is is healthy. Well, we learned about this story from Drew Pinsky who is a video Blogger and if you look on YouTube you will come across many of his escapades. He has his own channel. He is really a very interesting guy. Now, believe it or not, he has travelled to every country in the world. That's a challenge. But he has done that and he has videoed this. He's. It's. Very interesting. It's really worthwhile to to look at some of his stuff. So anyway, he came across the story of this lady from Ethiopia who claimed that she doesn't eat and she doesn't drink. So obviously this was a target to check out. So he eventually tracked her down in Ethiopia. It wasn't easy, but eventually he did and she told him that it's true that she doesn't eat, she doesn't drink, etcetera. He started to question some of the people in the little village and they also claimed that they had never seen her eat or, or or drink. And then there was a story of how the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, who had heard about her, had actually sent her to Qatar and Dubai in order to be tested by doctors to see whether or not this really was true. And she's claimed that, yes, doctors had documented this, that she had been examined there. And she even showed Drew her passport, which had stamps from Ethiop, from Dubai and from Qatar to, I guess, prove that she had been there and been seen by doctors. Well, that isn't really proof. I'm not sure how Drew in in this video blog eventually concluded that he found no evidence of fraud. Well, the fact is that he was there for two days and yes, for two days he didn't see or eat or drink. What does that mean? Anyone can go for a couple of days without eating or or drinking. I mean, if I came across this story, I would want to, you know, push this a little further. I mean, claiming that someone hasn't eaten for 18 years, that's quite a claim. You want to follow that up? I mean, I would have said, all right, let's let's just rent a hotel room and you go into that hotel room and we'll make sure that nothing goes in there. And this would have been very simple thing to do. He didn't. He just somehow after two days came to this conclusion. I, I guess part of it is because that of course, made headlines on his video, you know, that that this wasn't confirmed to be fraud. But there's no question, of course it was. I mean, we, we can listen to the American philosopher Thomas Paine, who said is it more likely that nature should go out of of course that man, or in this case a woman should tell a lie. Well, I think the answer is obvious. I think this is a woman who has lied. It's as simple as that. It is physiologically not possible to go for 18 years without food or drink. We know what happens unfortunately, because we see this in the world when people go without food for just several weeks and malnutrition does does them in. So as you can see, there's a lot of silly stories out there about about food, but we're of course interested in the hard science which tells us that we eat roughly 5 1/2 lbs of food everyday on on average, and that's over 2000 lbs a ton of food each of us consumes every year. So the first thing you know to ask scientifically is what is that? But what what are we really putting into our body? Well, first let's look at the composition of the body, which is, is this. As you know, we are mostly water and then protein, very low carbohydrate actually in the body, some fat. And we can even calculate what we are in terms of atomic composition. Obviously we have a lot of oxygen atoms in our body because we're mostly made of water and water contains oxygen, fats and carbohydrates and proteins all contain oxygen. So of course oxygen is the most prevalent atom. So here you have some idea of what what we are made of. What would happen if we combusted the body? What would be left behind? Well, of course we know this because cremation is obviously is a real thing, right? It has been studied when you burn the body, the fats, the proteins, the carbohydrates are consumed. They go off into the air as carbon dioxide and water. What is left behind really is the bones. So that's the result of cremation. What they will do when a body has been cremated is they will use a cremation magnet to remove anything. You know, if someone had any metal implants, they will remove that and then they will put the rest of the stuff into the cremulator, which will basically powder it all. It's essentially a powerful mixer and what comes out is a powder. And you know, as you've seen in in movies, this can be, you know, cast into the ocean or cast into the air, whatever that is what remains of us. If the body is totally combusted, it's about 3.5% of the original mass of the body. What is it? It's essentially the minerals that we have because all the carbon compounds, everything has, has gone to carbon dioxide, but we are left with the, the phosphorus, with the iron, the of the minerals. So that's what we're made of. But there's something else in our body that I already mentioned to you earlier. We also are full of microbes and there are many microbes in our body, both inside of us and outside of us. There are actually as many bacterial cells in the body as human cells, roughly about .2kg of bacteria in in our body. Bacterial cells of course, are much smaller than human cells, so we don't look like bacteria. But these bacteria now are receiving a tremendous amount of of attention. We see publications all the time showing how these microbes interact with the body, and I'm sure you've heard that there are good bacteria and bad bacteria and that we should be eating fermented foods like like kimchi and yogurt because they furnish us with good bacteria. Well, there is some truth to that. There are trillions of bacteria of many different species in our body. Some of them are potentially harmful, those of the pathogenic ones that can cause disease, but many of them are very useful. Why? Because they will, in the colon digest the food that we are not able to digest and they will produce benevolent byproducts like short chain fatty acids, which are then absorbed into the body. And they encourage the the body's immune system to, to kick into, into gear. So there are a lot of studies out there about, you know, how the microbes interact with, with the human body. So, you know, it's becoming pretty clear that the body is a very, very complex system. And given that we are what we eat, we have to start thinking about, you know, what we need to eat to satisfy the body composition that we have just established. Well, the components of food can be divided into different categories. There are the macro nutrients which make up the bulk of the food that we eat. These are the carbohydrates, the proteins and the fats and they perform different functions in in the body. The carbohydrates essentially are a source of energy. Basically they break down to glucose. Glucose burns in the body to produce carbon dioxide and and water. The body is essentially A combustion machine. Our muscles are made of protein. Our skeleton has protein in it. Proteins are composed of amino acids. We'll talk about that, of course. So proteins are structural parts of the body, but they play other roles as well because they also are they make enzymes. Then there are the fats. Well, fats provide the cushioning around our organs and also can serve as a source of energy. When you run out of carbohydrates, both excess fat and excess proteins eventually turn into fat. So it's not only the fat that we eat that becomes fat in our body, overconsumption of proteins and carbohydrates also contributes. So the essential macro nutrients are the proteins, the carbohydrates and and the fats. And in terms of carbohydrates, the main component is glucose. So starch breaks down into glucose, which is the way that the body uses it. And the body is not capable of storing a large amount of carbohydrate. It can store some in the form of glycogen in the body, in the liver, which is a chain of of glucose molecules joined together. But that is a very limited supply, which is why, as you know, if you are engaging any protracted activity such as long distance running or long distance bicycling, you have to keep furnishing your body with carbohydrates. So you'll see the marathoners drinking their liquids or eating their gels, which basically are a form of of sugar. Besides the carbohydrates, which of course are are, are essential. Proteins are also essential because these are what furnishes with the amino acids and amino acids have numerous roles in the body. As you'll see in in in a few minutes, there are about 20 amino acids that make up all of the proteins in the food that we eat. Nine of these are essential, meaning that the body cannot make them. The others can be made from the essential 1. So they're the 9 essential amino acids that must be part of our of our diet. And you know what the protein sources are meat, fish, eggs, etcetera. Then there are the fats. There are some essential fats as well, not as many as as amino acids, but there are some omega-3 fatty acids and some Omega 6 fatty acids. We'll see what those terms mean, which are necessary in the diet because again, the body cannot make them. Besides these essential macro nutrients, the carbohydrates, the proteins and the fats, we also have to eat some micronutrients. These are the minerals, this is the iron, this is the phosphorus that has to be present in our food supply, some in higher doses than others. For example, calcium we need much more of than we need the iron. But relative to the carbohydrates, fats and proteins, these are needed in very small amounts. Then there are substances in the diet which are important, which do not fall into any of those categories. These would be what we refer to as phytochemicals. Phyto meaning plant. These are chemicals that are found in plants which are not fats, they're not carbohydrates, they're not proteins, they're not minerals, they're separate category. Polyphenol refers to specific aspect of their molecular structure and there's many different types of these polyphenols. Collectively they act as antioxidants. They mop up those reactive species called free radicals, which are by products of metabolism which can be dangerous. So these are very beneficial. And then we have fibre, which we already mentioned earlier. Now fiber actually can be a form of carbohydrate. It is made of of of very small carbohydrate units joined together. But they're different from the other carbohydrates that we talked about because they are indigestible. We don't have the enzymes to break these down. So the fiber goes through the stomach, goes through the small intestine and goes to the colon. But it does perform important functions and we need a fair bit of this. I mean, the current recommendation is about 25 grams of fibre a day, which as you'll see when we look at some numbers, it's a pretty significant amount. But fibre serves many important functions. It can reduce the levels of cholesterol in in the blood. It can dampen the glucose spike that you normally get after a a meal. It makes you feel full so you're less likely to overeat at controls Constipation and and diarrhea. And it is the source of these beneficial short chain fatty acids that that I mentioned. So fibre is a critical part of the diet, but in order to evaluate how much you're taking gain, you have to have some notion of where it's found. Now, of course, I don't expect you to to look at this now and evaluate it, but you can look at it later and make some sort of calculation about your own diet and see whether or not you approach 25 grams of fiber a day. I would wager that most of you do not. Now if that is the case then you might want to think of upping your fibre by eating, you know some more foods that contain fibre. Some people choose to do that by supplements and the one that I mentioned to you earlier was the psyllium husk known as Metamucil is a trade name nephoritis Metamucil. You can also get in form of cookies and some people to that because that's a tasty way to get fiber into your body. But there's a but here, if you look at those cookies and look at the sugar content, right? There's, there's 7 grams of, of sugar there. That's, that's quite a bit. It is much better to get your fiber from something that has very little sugar like fiber one. Now it's also interesting to point out that fiber one of course would be in the category of an ultra processed food and yet it is one of the more nutritious cereals that that you can eat. So you cannot, you know, put all ultra processed foods in the garbage. It depends which specific one we're talking about. If you look at the nutritional profile here, you see that it has almost no sugar. So this is a very good way of getting your of fiber. All right, so, so far we have established that our body needs carbohydrates, our body needs fats, our body needs proteins, our body needs minerals, we need various kinds of phytochemicals in the polyphenol category and we need fiber. So we're going to look at these specifically protein soon. As we mentioned protein, people think meat and they think muscle. That's what what comes to your mind that if you want to build muscle, you got to eat meat. That of course is not the case. But beside, before we get into that, we have to establish that proteins serve many other functions in the body than just building muscle. Are enzymes, which are the biological catalysts that are involved in virtually every reaction that makes life possible. Those are proteins, for example, the digestive enzymes, which are cranked out in our saliva, they're cranked out by the pancreas, they're cranked out by cells in our intestine. These are all proteins and they all serve specific functions. Amylase, for example, breaks down amylose, which is a type of carbohydrate, into glucose, which the body can then use. If someone is deficient in digestive enzymes, potentially there are remedies because you can take supplements of digestive enzymes. I mean, there's no point in taking this if you don't have any digestive problems. And if you have a digestive problems, you need to see a gastroenterologist and they may then recommend something like this. So enzymes are proteins and to give you a simplified view, what what do they do? What do enzymes actually do? They allow chemicals to come together and react. And this would be a pictorial way of demonstrating that. So you have two substances in this case, let's say they have to be taken apart. So you're looking at something like chain of glucose or chain of amino acids that the body has to break down into into its individual components. So an enzyme would have a reactive site into which the molecule would fit and the enzyme would then allow it to disengage and and break apart. This is a process known as catabolism. Something is being broken down. But enzymes are also important in putting things together. For example, when you have to make DNA, which you always have to do every time that a cell divides, you have to make more DNA, which means putting together it's components, the nucleotides. Well, in this case those individual components interact with the enzyme. The enzyme allows them to react and you have a product. So proteins are extremely important because there are enzymes in our our body. Then there are other proteins which are critical to life as well. Insulin, which is the cell's gatekeeper for glucose. Glucose cannot enter a cell without help from insulin. And of course, if you don't have enough insulin, then you're looking at diabetes, Human growth hormone, which allows us to grow. That's a protein, so it's much more than building muscle. So here is a compendium for you. All of the things that proteins do in, in, in our body, they of course, are structural. They are part of the muscle. They they are enzymes. They can be signaling molecules, the antibodies that we form when our body learns to react against an antigen, against some foreign substance. Antibodies are are proteins. Hemoglobin, which is the molecule that carries oxygen around the system and red blood cells. That's a protein. So it's obvious that proteins are critical to life, so we do have to understand what they are. The basic molecule of which all proteins are composed is the amino acid. Amino acids are characterized by two things. One end of the molecule is this COOH grouping and on the first carbon next to that carbon, which is called the alpha carbon, you have a nitrogen. That is the basic structure of an amino acid. But as I told you, there are many different amino acids. So what is the difference? The difference is what else is attached to that first carbon, the alpha carbon. In this case we indicate that with an R, which in chemistry we use the same way as we would use X in in mathematics. So the simplest possible amino acid would be glycine because it contains a simple NH two group and there's no other substituent attached to the carbon beside the carboxyl carbon. The next simplest one would be alanine which has a methyl group and if these two combine you would get what we call a peptide. A peptide is a combination of amino acids. So when we eat food, the proteins, which are composed of amino acids, will be broken down into their individual amino acids, which the body then combines into peptides. Peptides combine to form proteins exactly where the the boundary is between peptide and protein. It's not a hard boundary, but generally you say that if there are more than 50 amino acids in the chain, you call it a protein. If there's fewer than it's a a peptide. But proteins basically are peptides that have been joined together. But there's more subtlety here, because once you have the protein chain, it also can twist and turn. So it can twist on itself into a Helix that's one of the shapes of a protein. So this is what we would call the secondary structure. The primary structure of a protein is the amino acids of which it is composed. The secondary structure is the way that the protein is shaped, right? The tertiary structure is when this helical shape twist on itself becomes a sort of like a a ball. That's the tertiary structure of proteins. And then when you have proteins that attach to each other, then you have what are called the quaternary structure. And interesting enough these days we know this, we can analyse the structure of proteins to a technique called X-ray crystallography and it's a very important technique. So we actually know the structure of these molecules. Now the nine essential assets that we need to to take in are not found in all foods. There are some foods that have all of them, for example meat. Fish will have all of the amino that all of the 9 essential amino acids, but not all vegetable sources will have that. Nuts for example may be rich in some amino acids and shorten in in the methionine let's say. So vegetable products can have amino acids, but not all the essential amino acids. And it used to be said in virtually in all Physiology books and in nutrition books that in order to have an adequate supply of amino acids that your body can turn into proteins, you had to eat them at the same time. This was what we now call as the plant protein fallacy. It used to be said that beans and rice were a great combination because beans are short in some amino acids and rice are rich in those amino acids so that if you get the combination, you get all. And people were told to to, you know, make sure that they're eating, if they don't eat meat, that they're eating the right combination. Today we know that this is, is is not true. The body can store these amino acids. You don't have to eat your beans and rice together. You can have rice for breakfast, beans for supper and your amino acids will still be there and capable of making the proteins that are are needed. Now. Beside making enzymes and beside making muscular proteins, the amino acids perform other functions as well. They are the raw materials from which the body makes some neurotransmitters. And these are the important chemicals that are released by one nerve cell. And as you know, they jumped a little gap between nerve cells called the synapse and fit into a receptor on the receiving nerve cell to trigger a reaction that's on nerve. Nerve stimulation proceeds some of the more famous neurotransmitters that you have heard of maybe serotonin or or nurpinephrine or dopamine would be another one. Well, the raw material from which the body makes these are amino acids. So amino acids of course, are are critical in, in, in in the diet. Nevertheless, when people think of proteins, they think of muscle building. So let's just explore this. Well, first of all, your muscles are not totally composed of protein. In fact, your muscles are like the rest of your body, mostly water. But of course there is protein, there are some fats, the mineral carbs, and there's some vitamins and and and minerals. But because certainly muscles contain protein, the thinking is if you want to build muscle, you got to eat your meat. This is a fallacy. If you want muscle, it's not what you put into your mouth that matters, it's what you do that matters. The way to build muscle is through exercise. That's what builds muscle. Having a larger stake is not going to give you larger muscles. That is just not how Physiology works. You must indeed have enough amino acids in your diet to supply whatever muscle growth you have because of the exercise that you do. But no matter how you're exercising, how much muscle do you think you can build in one day? I mean, do you think that you can look into the mirror after one day and see that after you've done your routine of barbells and what else, that you can actually see more muscle? No, this takes a long time. So while you are building muscle every day through exercise, the amount of amino acids that you need to produce that amount of muscle is easily available in the diet. But protein has taken on this mantle of being sort of the magical ingredient that we must get. So we have all of the protein enriched foods, right? You have the high protein cereals, you have high protein bread. You can buy protein bars or, or yogurts are enriched with protein, You make shakes with protein, you can buy beverages which are enhanced in protein, right? None of that is going to do you any good if you think of muscle building unless you do the exercise. So while protein is important and numbers are critical, and we're going to take a look because we have a pretty good idea these days of what we should be eating. I mean, nutritional science has been advancing significantly over the last 100 years. We have a pretty good idea of what we should be eating. And so we will take a look at that what we should be eating in terms of proteins, carbohydrates and, and the fats. And we'll start here with the with the proteins. Now the recommendation that is very common in in societies, you know, everywhere, especially in, in advanced societies, is that you need minimum of 0.8 in grams of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. So for an average sized adult, that translates to about 60 grams of protein. That's not a huge amount. We'll see how, how, how you can get that. Now, it is true as you get older you start to lose muscle. Muscle wasting is what it is called. So as you get older, you don't need to up your protein intake somewhat. And then if you are into serious bodybuilding or serious weightlifting where you are actually creating muscle, then you do need a little bit more protein. And you can go up to, to about, you know, one point 1.5 now in the new US guidelines that have just come out where they urge us to eat real food, whatever that means. What is real food? I mean is, is alter processed food not real food. You know, of course what what they really mean is, is to eat more fruits, vegetables, the unprocessed carbs, etcetera. Anyway, they have upped the requirement for protein from the .8 to 1.21 point 6 because Kennedy thinks that you should be eating more protein. He actually I I must say for his age, which is early 70s, he's a pretty good physical specimen. He can do impressive pull ups and I suppose he he probably has a good diet and eats a lot of of protein. Anyway, let's let's get a feel for the amount of protein that that you should be taking in. Now remember that we said that for, you know, roughly your average size, we're talking 6070 grams, minimal protein. If you're going to be exercising, weightlifting, bodybuilding, you'll need some more. If you have a steak, that's about 90 grams of of protein. So that would certainly meet your daily requirement, but it's not the best way to get it because that's also big source of saturated fat. A glass of milk will give you 8 grams yogurt, 15g piece of chicken breast, about 50 grams of of protein. A salad, depending on how you make that salad, especially if you put egg into it, that can give you about 30 grams of of, of protein. So you can see, you know, coming up to sixty 7080 grams is is, you know, not that difficult, but what if you don't eat any animal food? And of course there are people who don't and, and you know, the question comes up, are you getting enough protein? You know, if, if you are consuming no animal food, yes you can because vegetables do contain protein. But you do then have to think about it because they are not as good a source as, as animal products. So you have to eat more, which is not a bad thing because then you're also getting more fibre, you're getting more other nutrients. But you know, in comparison to to me I mean 3. 3 oz a small piece of, of beef will give you a 30 grams. And so these are all animal products and they are richer in, in, you know, amino acids than the vegetable products. I mean, that's just the fact. Now, in terms of your usual diet, you can get a glimpse of of, you know, protein content and as long as you can see that there are some animal products in there. Yeah, you're you're getting it right. So just based on on what we just said here, just by show of hands, how many of you think you are getting 6070 grams of protein a day? OK, show of hands who think you're not all right. Well, in that case, that's when you start to consider this. These are the protein supplements and usually they're made from whey that was left behind when you make cheese. And a scoop of this is an easy way to get 2530 grams of of protein. You just dissolve it in whatever liquid and you you drink it. So there it's the protein. So in summary, protein that you ingest breaks down to amino acids. These amino acids are used to make muscle. They're used to make antibodies, they're used to make enzymes. And when you run out of carbohydrates to burn, you can also burn protein. The fact is, regardless of whether they come from carbs, fats or proteins, eventually any extra source of calories will end up as body fat. That's the sad truth of it all right Now, in terms of whether or not taking in more protein is worthwhile, this has been studied. There are numerous studies on this and the studies show that no matter what kind of bodybuilding that you do, it is not that difficult to supply your body with enough protein. Taking in excessive amount of protein does not translate into greater muscles. What translates is doing the exercise, but you got to have the minimum amount of amino acid that will supply the protein. There's also the the question of when you should eat protein. If you're doing bodybuilding, if you're doing heavy duty exercise, that is the timing. And again, there are many publications about this. It turns out it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter when in the day you take in your, your protein, whether you eat it for breakfast or lunch or whatever, doesn't matter. Now to get back to the, you know, the recommended amounts. This is what you know comes out of the .8g per kilogram of body weight. And so now you can see that, you know, for someone who's not overly active, about 60 grams. If you do more activity, it, it, it goes up. If you really do muscle building goes up. But it's still not all that difficult to do, especially, I mean, if you start supplementing. But again, for the last time, if you are going to want to improve your musculature, you do it by lifting weights, by doing the exercise, not by exercising your mouth. That's not going to do it. There is something though that comes up as a question, especially these days because it has gotten so much publicity, and that is creatine. Creatine is an amino acid, as you can see by the molecular structure. Creatine is in fact one of these dietary supplements which has scientific legitimacy but in a very limited way. What creatine can do is produce ATP, replenish your ATP that has been broken down into ADP in its supplying of of energy. This is the basic idea. We said that when you eat glucose, your body uses the energy to make ATP, which is the body's energy currency. Energy is released when it breaks down to make ADP, and then it has to be recycled into ATP. That is where creatine comes in. There's an enzyme called creatine kinase. This allows creatine to form phosphocreatine, and phosphocreatine regenerates ATP. So once again, here we go. ATP is what your body uses for energy. When you're using it, it becomes ADP. That's when you run out of energy. You need to regenerate the ATP. That's where creatine comes in. Well, where does creatine come from? The body can actually make it from other amino acids. It is also present in foods as creatine. And of course you can incorporated into your body as a supplement. Now, the amount of creatine that is found in food is enough to regenerate ATP in your regular daily life. However, supplements can be beneficial in certain conditions. Not for the vast majority of the population, but for those who are into serious weightlifting, into bodybuilding, or into sports where you need repeated short bursts of energy. So important to understand, creatine does not build muscle, but what it does allow you to do is do more repetitions of whatever exercise that you're doing because you're not going to run out of energy as quickly. So it's the more repetitions that will build the muscle, not the creatine, but the creatine allows you to do the more repetitions and to have faster recovery. Yes, you got to yell so I can hear. I wish I could hear, but it's very difficult. Acoustics here are terrible. No, the the the balance is favorable. OK, I mean to, to regenerate the ATP from ADP of course requires some energy, but at the same time you're also making extra ATP from the food that you're eating. So the overall balance is is positive that is taking the creatine will enhance ATP formation. I mean that's that's a fact. But it doesn't work for things like the marathon or long term bicycling. OK, because there you don't need a quick source of energy. What you need quick source of energy is when you are sprinting when or hockey would be a great example because here you have 2030 second shifts where you're going all out. So you very quickly deplete your ATP. It has to be recycled. So the events where it works are short swims like the 100 meter swim, the 200 meter swim, the 100m run, high jumping where you need that quick burst of energy. Even in in football where each play is just a few seconds, right, But you need that quick burst of of energy. That's where it works. Swimmers, for example, benefit a great deal. It is totally legal. This is not one of the substances that is regulated by the Anti Doping Agency. It's a total legal supplements and all swimmers take it, and most athletes who are engaged in the sports here do take it. Anyone here who's engaged in any of these sports who regularly takes creatine? What sport? Football. And what have you found from experience? Yeah, from your experience. Reduces concussion that stores water better so you. Feel. You feel better, you feel more energetic. Any swimmers? That's where, Yeah, yes, what distance where it really makes a difference in the, in the short sprints and you know, in, in the 100 meters where you're in competitive, you're talking about, you know, fraction of a second difference there it it really matters. But of course when you talk about the Olympic swimming, they all take it. So even that's kind of equalizes anyway they, they, there are questions about, you know, creatine, what else it can do besides give you this bits of energy. There are some studies that show benefits in in cognition is somewhat questionable. But one thing that we do know is that there's no risk in taking creatine. This has been really very well, well studied. And when you're taking the 5 grams of creatine, which is, you know, what most athletes take, there's no risk associated with that. But as I said, I mean, as there's no point in just taking it if if you're not into the sports that I mentioned, I mean, it's not, it's not going to give you extra energy or all right. Now, one more topic that we'll tackle today is the topic of fats, which are the second class of these macro nutrients that that we need chemically. We refer to them as triglycerides. And this is the general structure. Now I, I know that that some of you have no background in chemistry at all and that this looks to you like musical notes. Look to me because I have no background in music, but all fats have a very similar molecular structure and they kind of look like a fork where there's a backbone that we call glycerol to which are there are three side chains attached and those are the fatty acids. So all fats fall into this category of triglycerides. They're 3 amino acids linked to a molecule of glycerol. That's why they're glycerides. But they can have differences in molecular structure that impact nutrition. So for example, when you have double bonds, more than one of them in the chain of the fatty acid, we refer to that as a polyunsaturated fat. Why unsaturated? Because it is not saturated in terms of the number of hydrogens it can possibly contain. If there's only one double bond, that would be a mono unsaturated fat. And if there are no double bonds, that is a saturated fat. It is completely saturated with hydrogen atoms. And then there's this obnoxious nuance of the trans fats, which are really unsaturated fats, but they have a different, what we call confirmation. They have a different bend in the molecule. I'll show you a picture of that in in, in a moment. And even though these are unsaturated fats, they don't behave like normal unsaturated fats. They are nutritionally more problematic anyway. The the fats that we take in, depending on their source, will have very different chemical composition. So for example, if you look at canola oil, you can see it has very little saturated fat. It has quite a lot of unsaturated fat and a lot of it is a monounsaturated fat, which is desirable. That is oleic acid. So we know the composition of all the fats that we take in. And what you're looking at here are actually also the seed oils, which Kennedy of course has has ludicrously demonized as as being UN unhealthy. Now, there are some seed oils that are better for us than others. The ones that contain more monounsaturated fats are are are better. But none of these are devils. Anyway. The function of fats in the body, I already mentioned that they can produce energy. When you run out of carbohydrates, the body starts burning fats, energy and our organs are also surrounded by fat. They provide cushioning. When you look at a blood cell which has a membrane that surrounds it, that membrane is made of fats. Fats in the diet help absorption of vitamins and just like amino acids that can be converted into useful biochemicals, the same thing can be said for fats. As you will see some of the molecules that you may have heard about prostaglandins or endocannabinoids, these are made from fats. The same way that we have some essential amino acids, we also have some essential fatty acids, not as many as amino acids. There basically are only two fats that you must have in the diet. Excuse me, because your body cannot make them. And this is linoleic acid and linoleic acid. The terms Omega 6 and omega-3 have to be clarified here. Omega comes from the ancient Greek, meaning last. So an Omega 6 fatty acid is one that has the first double bond from the end of the molecule on the 6th carbon. So the end of the molecule is the end other than the COOH end and you count the carbons. And if the first double bond is on the 6th carbon, you have an Omega 6th fat. If it is on the third carbon, you have an omega-3 fat. So the essential fatty acids, there is one type of fatty acid which is an omega-3. The other type is an Omega 6. If you take a look at composition of of fats or the the content of fats, you get an idea here. So we're looking at all the more common sources of fat and in the diet, and these are all high in alphalenolic acid, which is the essential fat. So there's really no problem in, in getting those. And then there are the omega-3 fats. And here the story becomes more interesting because there is one omega-3 fat that I I mentioned, which is the alpha linolenic acid, which is easily available from vegetable oils. But there's another type omega-3, which is beneficial, but it is not essential. And it's not essential because the body can make it. The body can make from alpha linoleic acid, which you have in, in, in vegetable fats. The body can convert that into the longer chain fatty acids, the icosapentanoic acid and glucosohexanic acid, that is the EPA and the DHA. But those can also be found naturally occurring in fish. So the longer chain omega-3 fats, the DHA and the EPA, which are found in fish, can also be made in the body from fats in vegetable sources. However, we now know that these omega-3 fats that come from fish have some added value in the diet, and we're unlikely to make enough of them from the omega-3 fats that are found in naturally occurring vegetable oils. I'll get back to that in a SEC, but the reason that the essential fatty acids are essential is because they are needed to make molecules in the body that perform all kinds of biochemical roles. The prostaglandins, for example, which are important in immune function, kidney function, regulation of blood pressure. These in the body are made from arachidonic acid, which in turn is made from linoleic acid, which is an essential fat the endocannabinoids. These are molecules that are very similar to cannabis. Now you way wonder, why is it that cannabis does certain physiological things in the body? Well, the answer to that is because it happens to resemble certain substances that the body actually uses physiologically. So the essential fatty acids like linoleic acid and the body are converted to arachidonic acid, which also furnishes endocannabinoids, which regulate mood, for example, or something we call a runner's high. That is all due to endocannabinoids. So these omega-3 fats are very interesting because of functions that they perform, and there are a number of these. Now remember that the omega-3 fats are most abundant in seafood, but they can also be made the same ones that are found in seafood can also be made in the body from vegetable sources, but that conversion is not very efficient. So that when we start examining the benefits of omega-3 fats, the long chain ones that are found in fish, we have to rely on eating fish. Why are these important? Well, the omega-3 fats, the ones that we find in fish can reduce blood triglycerides. Triglycerides are free fats floating around in the bloodstream that can deposit in arteries and result in narrowing of the arteries. There's also some evidence that they can reduce the risk of irregular heartbeats. They can have a modest effect on lowering heart rate and reducing blood pressure. They have a mild anticoagulant effect, reducing the chance that blood clots will form and they have a modest anti-inflammatory effect. And there's also some evidence, not that conclusive about cognitive function enhancement. We also know that when you have a sufficient of these omega-3 fats in the diet, any build up of fatty deposits, the plaque in arteries is less likely to rupture, which would cause the formation of a blood clot that can trigger a heart attack. This is a reason why these fish oils actually are used medicinally. They are prescribed to patients. They're approved for reducing triglycerides which are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. And of course, when you have approval of something like this is a medicine, it means that it has been studied and that, you know, we have very good evidence of benefit and, and, and risk. Now, there is a mild risk with high doses of these omega-3 supplements and that risk is atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat. However, it is also true that in people who already have atrial fibrillation, these fish oils will reduce the chance that the atrial fibrillation triggers a cardiovascular event. So, you know, there is plusers and and minuses here. But nevertheless, I mean, the overwhelming evidence is that the benefits of these things outweigh the risks. And some of these benefits are even things like arthritis, people taking fish oils who before were, you know, had difficulty moving their joints do better. The question is, if you're going to increase your intake of of these omega-3 fats, do you do it by eating or by taking supplements? The advice is is very rigorous here. If you can do it by eating fish, that's what you should do. Supplements are secondary. Now in some cases, if someone for whatever reason cannot eat fish due to fish allergy or whatever, then you can do supplements. And interestingly enough, even if you have a fish allergy, you can take omega-3 fish oil supplements because the oil does not contain the protein that causes allergic reactions. Or you can get an omega-3 supplement that is extracted from algae, which is actually where fish get it. I mean, your question was, you know, why do fish have omega-3 fats? They get it from the food that they eat, which is which is algae. How do you know whether or not you have enough omega-3 in your diet? The only way to know is to test it. The only way. And there is a test that is available, it's called the Omega-3 index. It's a very simple test. It's you get a kit, you prick your finger, you take a drop of blood, you put it on a filter paper and you send it in to them and they analyse it. And the analysis will tell you the amount of the EPA and DHA that is the fish oils that are found in your body relative to the total amount of fatty acids. And based on numerous studies, the conclusion is that if you have less than 4% of the total fats in your body in the form of these long chain omega-3 fatty acids, you are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease. If you are in the more than 8% category, you're fine. So what, what conclusion do we we, we have here? If you eat fish a couple of times a week, it is very unlikely that you you have a shortage of these omega-3 fats. If you don't eat fish at all and don't take any supplements, there's a good chance that your omega-3 index would be less than 8%. And then one might consider taking a supplement. But really the only way to know is to do that that test. But the recommendation is to eat fish once or twice a week and then you'll be in the in the right ballpark. Now the problem is that most people of course don't because the diet in North America today is so heavy on these ultra processed foods. And those contain the, the, the, the standard vegetable fats that we talked about, which do have the alpha liolinic acid, which is the vegetable source of an omega-3. But it's not the same omega-3 as you find in fish, although in the body some of it is converted to, to the longer chain one. It's a very inefficient process. Now, there's a couple of other things that we need to mention when we're talking about fats. There's a term that comes up that you've often heard. It's called hydrogenation. This is a method of turning liquid fats into solid fats. Now, why would you want to do that? For example, in the making of margarine, that's exactly the process. People want margarine because they don't want butter. They don't want animal product where you can take a vegetable oil, pass hydrogen gas through it using a nickel or Palladium catalyst, and you add the hydrogen to the double bonds and you get a saturated fat. The trouble is that when you do this hydrogenation, there's a side reaction where some of the unsaturated fat that you're trying to hydrogenate converts into the transform. It's a change in the geometry of the double bond and those trans fats are a problem. These are the molecules that are linked with increased risk of stroke and increased risk of heart disease. This is one reason why you want to cut down on these ultra processed foods. But the definition of these ultra processed foods is also somewhat of a difficult business. A Brazilian nutritionist came up with a way to try to determine which foods are ultra processed and he came up with this Nova classification. Nova is not an acronym. It's not short for anything. It's just the name of the system. And here it is the the category one are your your untainted fruits, vegetables, nuts, which receive no processing. Category 2 are things like like the seed oils which are processed from foods in category one, but the the processing stops at that at that single conversion. The ultra processed foods are the ones that you normally think of as you know, the, the junk foods, right? The the your chips, your your cakes, cookies, the etcetera. But it isn't a real standard definition. I mean the the the categories are not so clear. One way to look at it and this has been suggested that if you look at the ingredients in a food and you see some components or additives there that you're not likely to find in your kitchen, in your kitchen cabinet, then you're likely looking at a highly processed foods. So you know, if you see that they have colour additives, they have flavour additives, they have emulsifiers, etcetera, you're looking at an ultra processed foods. And but the trouble is that these foods that have those components that make it out of process are also the ones that are heavy in salt and sugar and in fat. That's the real reason to stay away from them. Why are they so popular? Because they are cheap to produce. The fats that are used in these foods, the saturated fats and the trans fats are very stable. They don't react with oxygen in the air. They don't go rancid. You can also use them in baking and they give texture to the food. So all of these are positive in terms of the manufacture, but not necessarily positive in terms of the of the consumer. Ultra processed foods are being looked at, you know, under the microscope, as it were these days. And we're getting more and more information. I mean, just about every day you will see some article in a magazine or in a book about the horrors of eating in these foods. But you also have to be careful about the media information because it is often tainted. So I'm going to give you one last example here of this. You know how careful you have to be when you read the studies? Well, first of all, you look at the title of the study and chances are you going to be horrified because you have absolutely no idea what what this means, right? It it seems like a collage of of words, lipids, lipodomics, etcetera. But if you look under, you see that they start talking about colorectal cancer and then you pay attention because this is one of the one of the cancers these days that is really worrisome because we're seeing more colorectal cancer in young people than we've ever seen before. Colorectal cancer used to be a disease of old age. We're seeing more colorectal cancer in young people now, people under 50. And that's, yeah, that's still young than we have ever seen before. So when they make some sort of, you know, statement about possibly reducing the risk of colorectal cancer, you start paying attention. OK, so let let's just analyze this paper and see what the media made of it. First of all, lipid. This is just a technical term for any kind of fatty substance. And lipidomics is the study of these substances. I mean, that's, that's the basic. So reporters read this paper and we started to see headlines. And these were the headlines common cooking oil could be causing colon cancer surge in young people, warn doctors. You can see all of these scary headlines, all in the same vein, all linking colon cancer to cooking oil, all referring to that study that we just looked at. When you start reading the study, it starts out with a legitimate statement. Over a century ago, Merchant proposed that cancer is due to chronic inflammation, and there's good evidence for that. Yes, chronic inflammation can lead to to cancer. So what did they do in this particular study? They had patients who had been diagnosed with colon cancer, who had tumors in their: They biopsied the colon to see what it was made of, what was in that tumor. And then they took normal tissue from the intestine where there was no tumor, and they biopsied that to see what the chemical composition was. So this was the heart of the experiment. They analysed tumors for their chemical composition compared to intestinal tissue that did not have any any tumor. And what they found was that the tumors had more pro inflammatory compounds than the tissue remote from the tumor. Well, what are these pro inflammatory compounds? We already mentioned these. The fatty acids can give rise to various metabolites. Some of these are pro inflammatory and some are anti-inflammatory. The omega-3 fats will produce substances that are anti-inflammatory. The Omega threes are pro inflammatory. So what the researchers said was that in the Western diet, which is of course low in fiber and rich in Omega 6 fatty acids such as linoleic, which is a precursor of an inflammatory substance, that the diet may influence the composition of the tumor. So what they said, look, we have some tumors here which have more compounds that are, that are derived from Omega 6 fats then from omega-3 fats. And therefore maybe it is the composition of those fats in the diet that is responsible. However, here is the critical point. These researchers never asked the subject about their diet. They never asked what they were eating. It was just an assumption that if they had more fatty acid of one type in the tumor than in the rest of the tissue, it must be because of the composition of the diet that they were eating. This is silly if you don't ask what they were eating. But anyway, the thrust of their study wasn't really the diet. What they said was because there are more pro inflammatory substances and tumors, they were looking to see if there was any herbal supplement that could be taken as an anti-inflammatory. So they studied that and they suggested that there might be some herbal supplements they actually came up with too that they said that you know they this might be beneficial. So that was the study. Tumors versus non tumorous tissue. The tumorous tissue had more substances that in theory could be derived from Omega 6 fats and the non tumorous tissue had more substances that could be derived from omega-3 fats. But they never asked what the patients were eating and never was there any mention of cooking oil. That word did not come up in the study that was invented by the media because they just assumed that it was the cooking oils that were altering the the diet that was gave the result that the researchers found. The researchers never linked it to cooking oil. They never even linked it to diet because they never asked about the diet. So as you can see, the media can be very, very misleading in terms of of misinterpretation. Now it is certainly true that our diet is overemphasizing Omega 6 and that is largely due to those ultra processed foods. That much is true. So I think we need to to, you know, balance this more. I think that's a very good reason to. To try to cut down on the ultra processed foods, not because of that particular study, but because the consensus is among all the studies that that the ultra processed foods are a problem. So here is one final paper on that where they looked at a large population. This is a set of studies carried out in France called the Neutral Sante study. For years and years they've studied thousands of people, their diet and their and their patterns of disease. And the conclusion is that a 10% increase in the proportion of ultra processed foods in the diet is associated with increase of more than 10% in risk of overall and and especially breast cancer. And so we go by the consensus evidence. And the consensus is when you look at the literature, you look at all of these studies, you see that that. The more ultra processed foods people eat, the greater the risk of heart disease, the greater risk of obesity, the greater risk of cancer. So what's the moral of the story? I think Canada's Food Guide is better. I think it's more pictorial than than what the Americans came up with. And it is what we started out with in the beginning saying that half that plate should be made of of fruits, vegetables. 1/4 of your plate should be made-up of whole grains with really a minimal amount of processed white flour. Stuff like your, you know, white toast bread. Go for the sourdough bread and the proteins and notice that and the protein does not have some giant slab of RIP steak in there or a whole Turkey like they have in in the US. Protein can be had from soybeans. They could be had from lentils, eggs or from from meat. So there is the, you know, the story of proteins and fats with some complications, but also a great deal of simplicity. You know, if we if you just balance your diet right, which is not all that that part to do, you're in the right ballpark. OK, Next time we're going to take a look at carbohydrates. And they of course are the source of energy and source of other things in your body as well. What should I call you? What should you call me? You call me whatever you want. Yes, you can call me. I just wanted to say I'm so excited to hear you mention the new Good Pyramid in the class. I just read it last week when it was published and I really wanted to like chat with you and I know why my professor highly recommend this course for good. What are you? What are you in? To your guys, To your guys. Nutrition. Yeah. So it's. You're out there at. The McDonald's. Back and I'm working in the farm. Would it it be better if I e-mail you first to chat with you or it is OK I just. Sure, I'm an e-mail man. You can come in and chat whenever. I just had a quick question. I'm not a. Nutritionist. Yeah. And in some of our courses we were learning about in like the developmental stages, how can be beneficial for kids to drink cold milk. Yeah, because it reduces the risk of obesity because they're getting more of their knowledge and very. And obviously, yeah, I agree with you that Kennedy has no idea what he's talking about. But do you think there's any credence to that in terms of the fact that higher percentage standards could lead? To a decrease in the risk. Well, the physical nutrition recommendation now is the like the dent, the activation fund that should do the whole. Do you think there's? Really like. That that could lead to like having nutrition in the whole life or anything like that. Work is probably over there, but. I still think that, OK, you know what, well, there's more controversial to the fact that you're used to, but I feel that comes down. Thank you. Have a good night. Yeah. I mean, unfortunately the registration is an automated system. Yeah, and spots open up, I mean, because couldn't believe it, but I think the alerts don't really work, really work. I mean, I send an e-mail, send an e-mail and because I actually have a way of of seeing. Whether or not there. Are spots, so I I can't guarantee that there are, but I I see if there are. This for a class in the past that I took during the fall semester that was required. I'm asking also because this class fits as an elective for a class for a school that I'm applying to in the fall. And I asked the same thing of an advisor for a psychology class I took in the fall and they give me a pass that I could register in. The class was in full, so. How? Who did you then show that to? The advisor for the faculty. So that's why I'm wondering if there's a good. This is offered by the. Well, I mean. No, it would be whatever advisor is for your program. OK. OK. I mean, if you send me an e-mail, I mean, I can say that it's OK with me, OK. And then you can show that to whoever, OK? OK, OK, thank. You so so much. For your help, Professor, just a good question. Is the pilot on paper or no multiple choice? It's online. Online. Thank you. I just had a quick question about the exams. I'm part of Canada across competitions and World Championships, which is like a reason that like I would be away quite a bit and I know that it's like posted so I will be able to follow along. So I just had a question if it was asynchronous the the exams, are they asynchronous like on your own time during the time slot from 6:00 to? From from six. To midnight. You can start it at any time and you have three hours. Like I can do it anywhere. Yes. OK, because I was just wondering because for February 5th I will be in Finland and I so I was just wondering if it's like in class or if it's on your own time like. No, it's it's on your own time, but it has to match our our time it. Will be at 1:00 AM but it's OK. That's your problem. Yes, OK. Thank you. OK. And sorry for the question, is the final exam the same format? As yes. Thank you so much. Hi, how are you? OK. I had a question. It wasn't about like exams or anything, so I don't know. Yeah, I'm feel bad, but I'm a waitress at our restaurants and last Saturday someone asked me about nitrates in in the food and whether there was nitrates in the food. And I paused for a second. I remember you mentioned it in last week's class, but I, I wasn't able to answer it because I couldn't remember what you said. I checked the notes and I mean, there was nothing about it because she was telling me that she didn't want to consume any nitrates. And I was just wondering, I was a big waitress. I got a lot of questions like this. I was wondering like what should I have answered to her or what? Would you? Well, I mean, what you should have answered is that you're not the person to ask. Yeah, I. Mean and people shouldn't expect the waitress to give nutrition. But they do all the. Time. Anyway, we are going to discuss nitrites in excruciating detail, right? And I mean, it's not the nitrite that's real problem. It's the food that the nitrite is is in. And generally it's in smoked meats, you know, ham, you know, processed meat, meats. That's the real problem, isn't nitrite. It's the fat and salt that you have in those foods. Bacon. Yeah. But there's also an issue of nitrites in the body forming compounds called nitrosamines, which are known carcinogens. So there is an issue with nitrites. It's a complicated issue. You know it's going to take us a while to discuss it, but what were they eating that they were asking it? Was a sandwich, so I think there was bacon in the. Sandwich right now, yes, I mean, but if you, if you're going to be eating bacon, worry more about the salt that is in there than about the nitrites. Yeah, cool. Good to know. Do you want? To focus on some details, the best way to to study is for each lecture, make up for yourself 15 to 20 questions that you would ask. If you have to make up an exam, that's the best way to do it and chances are you'll be banned on because that's that's how you think about what's important and what isn't when you have to do. Do it yourself. OK, thank you. And also I just wanted to say that your way of presenting is really like nice. Thank you. So much so. When you're going over the way I know we're looking at proteins before based on no wheats and stuff like that, you might naturally see and explain that. I think we was like a byproduct of like what's leftover after cheese, cheese and. Stuff. But I mean, that doesn't mean that's not good for protein. Yeah. So I was thinking like, in that case, like what negatives it might have compared to, let's say, a chicken breast. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I mean the whey is balanced amino acid composition. It's extremely good protein source. You know, there's no no issue with it. I mean people who take protein supplements, it's usually whey. Yeah, yes, but I do. But I was wondering if. There's no, there's there's no downside to it, OK. I mean, the, the only question is whether you should be taking a protein supplement. Yeah, yeah. And also with creatine. I was wondering so I know we looked at the chart with 5 grams. 5G Yeah, I'm going to get some food. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, because I, I actually take some for swim. I. What do you swim? What distance? 100 breasts, so I use. Yes. It makes a difference. Oh yeah. But what's your time? Like one O. Five one O 5. Yeah, well, it will make a difference. Yeah, but. But it will make a difference for your competitors too. Yeah. But with coroutine, I was wondering like is it similar in terms of I think vitamin C? Like if you have like let's say 600, six, 100% of your like daily intake and vitamin C, it'll just get peed out. Yes, yes, with 5 grams of creatine you saturate your your tissues. If they it does, you know what to take anymore. No, OK, OK. Because I was like obviously with my coach like Oh yeah, yeah, take it, take it. I want to like make sure obviously nothing and. And neither does it matter when you take it doesn't really. I mean whether you take it just before you. Revamp or anyone? Because I was. Thinking just you have to take it everything. Yeah, yeah, I was thinking the same thing with protein. I was surprised to hear it doesn't matter what time. Well, thank you for the advice that we use well in my. Mutes and everything. Can you document that you actually did better once you started taking? Yeah. Well, I I've been using some but it's I'm not consistent with every day but. You've got to be consistent. Yeah, yeah. All right. Thank you. I do want. To send some crowd. I do want to send some crowd because I'm almost. What do you swim? 101 hundred and watts correct? So it's same thing as I'm proud of myself because it's really, I know I'm really proud of us. I didn't, it was last time was the 19 I'm really proud of. You so you're taking creatine? My mom was always scared of supplements so she never allowed me to take any. Well I mean you don't feel scared of creatine. I know the culture is an. Art. But I mean, how, how competitive are you? Very. No, Oh, I swam like Max. I I never did like Olympics or whatnot. I just did in my swimming pool had like what do you call it area within competition to each other. That's it. And then what we'll. Swim then. Well, I mean if you're swimming you're 100 breast stock. If you're swimming getting 110. I mean with creatine you you get it down to one O 8 maybe something like that two. Whole. Seconds. Yeah, OK. Yeah. I haven't swimmed in so long so probably now I'll do like 120. Five. Like, I mean, yeah, it missed. My knees though, if I were a competitive swimmer. I would take creatine, yeah. OK, everybody does it. Yeah, everyone, everyone does it. I mean, of course, that's one of the problems that everyone does it. So is there any like, is it even better anymore 'cause everybody? 'S taking. It 5 grams. You saturated your tissues. There's no point in taking anymore. OK, yeah, I wanted to ask the. Bird it wasn't clear to me how it helped with the RDP. Is it that it transforms RDPADP back to ADP? Yeah, OK, Yeah, OK. And I had another. Question regarding Omega 6 and omega-3. Since Omega 6 creates pro inflammatory, is it bad? Well, it's bad if you have it in excess. I mean, they, you know, they these days the recommended ratio is 3 to 1, Omega 6 to omega-3. OK, OK. When that ratio you have no problem. If people are eating all this ultra processed food, you're looking at that. 12:50. I see. OK. So with the connecting guidelines diet, we should have a reasonable preparation. Of yes, numbers matter. OK, you know. And regarding omega-3, there is no like toxic dose if we are if we are above about the 8% it. Well there's no toxic dose, the only thing is that it will start to accumulate. Then you put on weight. I see. OK. OK, OK. Thank you so much. OK, have a good. Day. All right, very silly question. Yeah, all. The time it was the since the lecture. Could you stop thinking about why, for example, when we eat chemicals, our body rejects them. We know it's not good for us. So why is it? What do you mean? Like what? What do you mean? Once my friend, she was she bought like, you know what? Rose water, which we can't drink. Yeah. Yeah. And she bought it and she like, she wasn't the smartest. She bought water for your face. So you had like added chemical inside of it. And she tasted. She was like, this is not normal. We looked and we noticed. So she kind of noticed that the chemical wasn't good for her before foods. For example, why is it that taste your foods like we prefer burgers over broccoli? If evolution makes us want to be better, why have our taste wasn't evolved for us to like broccoli more? Like, well, you you. You prefer burgers over broccoli not because it's better for you. You prefer it because you like the taste. You. Have a lot of taste not choosing with why it's not tasting with evolution if it's supposed to like be will be healthier if you. Why I Because you think that your. Body should be able to know what what to do No, it doesn't doesn't have like any triggers inside of it to be like doesn't work like that. Your your body is not it's not an intelligent machine that knows what you should be eating Your brain is what you know determines that I mean the the trouble is that you know the the the ultra processed crap tastes good. Why? I don't understand why? Because people like the taste of salt and fat and sugar. They they the combination of fat and sugar is is a magical combo when it comes to taste. That's why Donuts. Taste so good I haven't you know that's I mean that's you know this is well known it's and I mean obviously the the food industry is an industry just like another industry I mean they're interested in making money so you know I mean if if. Mixing. Sugar. With fat. Is we're going to make you money, that's what you're going to do. So how often do you swim? So that's. Everybody's. How accessible is this room? None. No. No. Lila. The foreign guerre exacto MO Sanger padmom de chasco vule ZA le Fer seko vu zale prove en buchi miser and suite ouzale over here and pay fable sans army. OK, a final MO Ouzale developed the scientific almo. Yeah.
