Well, welcome to all of you who were with us last semester. How many of you last semester? Rest of you, all newbies. All right, very good. Let's get started. First, I I have to apologize a little bit for my voice. I I've been struggling with the remnants of this damn flu for a couple of weeks. I can sort of speak, OK, I just can't hear, so doesn't matter. I've heard myself before, but hopefully you can. You can hear. All right, let me start off with a professorial story. One day Prof, very much like a class like this, looked out at the students and walked over to the side of the lecture room and picked up a bottle with a wriggling live worm in it, poured in a little bit of tobacco juice and the worm died. Picked up another bottle, poured in a little bit of chocolate liqueur and the worm died. And did it one more time and poured in a little bit of alcohol and the worm died. Then he looked out at the students and said, what do you make of that? One clever little guy in the back said, Sir, I know if you drink, smoke and eat chocolate, you don't have to worry about worms. Well, obviously he made the right observation but came to the wrong conclusion. Science is all about making observations and coming to conclusions, coming to the proper conclusion. That, of course, is going to be one of the points of emphasis in in this course. As some of you may know, I'm also a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, and I abide by his famous dictum about the importance of having facts. Before you have theories, it's the facts that have to come first. Then you build a theory, not the other way around. My view is that chemistry is the thread that ties all the other sciences together. I think chemistry is the basic science. It should be in the limelight. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees with that view. There are those for whom chemistry is the work of the devil. They think that the word chemical is synonymous with poison or toxin. They think that chemists are these strange creatures locked up in a laboratory somewhere just waiting to see what new cancer causing additive they can unleash on the unsuspecting public. Then there are those who think that chemists are a totally different breed altogether, and hopefully we can convince you that that is is not the case. But the important point to remember is that chemicals are not to be feared. Neither are they to be worshipped. They are to be understood. They're just things. They make no decisions. People make decisions about how we use chemicals, and we can use them judiciously or inappropriately. But with that little bit of introduction, let's get to the course itself. Chemistry of Food you can find me in auto mass 110 which is on on the ground floor. You're welcome to come at any time and visit my ducks. There are about 350 of them in the office and they enjoy visitors. There are 4 tutors, Discourse Hosna who's here is the head tutor and she will be your main contact and any questions that you have come first we addressed there and then you can address them to me as as as well. Now in terms of the mechanics of the course, there are two midterm exams. They are online and you can see the dates here. Now, the way this works is that you access it through my courses and you can start at any time. After 6:00, you will have three hours. No matter when you start. You can start up to 11:59 at night. You will still have 3 hours. Now sometimes there's a bit of a glitch there. If you start at that time and you finish after midnight, you may get a notice saying that you haven't properly submitted. Just ignore that it's it all works. So from the moment that you start, you have three hours. This takes into account all students who have registered with the disability office, which means that everybody gets extra time. The three hours is way more than what you need to complete the exam. So this already includes the extra time for students who have registered with the office of of disabilities. There's just one other thing I I will mention is that there is to be no copying of any way of the questions that pop up on the screen when you do your your exam. No copy paste, no print screen, nothing like that. That is regarded as cheating and it is dealt with very, very severely by the Dean's office. We have technology to detect if that is happening, if you are using your computer during the exam to do any copying. So don't do, don't do it. There will be some reading assignments and some questions from those assignments on the exam. We'll talk about that later, just before the before the exam. The course of course is in person as you know, but because the lectures are recorded, we have allowed more students to register than there are seats in the course. There are more than 1200 registered students who come to class. I think get more out of the course. I think it's it's more enjoyable. But certainly the recorded lectures are are fine, but we cannot guarantee, you know, when you live by technology, you die by technology. And it's pretty complicated technology. I mean, this room is equipped to do automatic recording. It usually works, but there have been cases when there's a failure. If that happens, do not come crying above that. There's nothing that can be done. This is a risk that you take by not coming to class. As some of you may know, aside from teaching these courses, I also direct our Office for Science and Society where we have a mandate to separate sense from nonsense. And as you can imagine that that is quite a challenging endeavor these days when there's so much nonsense going around. We do have a website and you will access it at mcgill.ca/OSS, which you must do because I will ask you to sign up for a weekly newsletter. And if you look in the top right hand corner of the website, simple click and it's a newsletter that will come to you every Saturday morning. And it includes a lot of articles of the type that we will deal with in in this course. So go to mcgill.ca/OSS & up. All right, let's get started with the meat of the course. And we're going to start in a way that I think you would not expect. And that is what Charles Dickens, one of the greatest English novelists of of all time. And there are two reasons why we're going to start with this. The second will become evident in a minute. But one of the reasons that I like to start with Dickens that most people do not know is that, believe it or not, he was an amateur magician. And I, I've been doing magic since I was in Grade 6. And it is a fascinating way to understand the way that things work, because a magician on the stage is really just an actor playing the role of a magician. Everything that is done is done by perfectly explicable scientific means. It's just that the audience isn't Privy to what those means are well, science can also look magical until you understand what is going on behind the scenes. And so magic is is pretty good introduction into critical thinking because when you see a magic performance, what you really think is how on earth did that happen? How did they do that? You're trying to analyze the science. Well, I told you that I've been doing this since I was in grade 6, and it was at that time that I was invited to a birthday party organized by my friend's parents and they had hired A magician to entertain us who was not very good. He was a teenager. Most of the tricks he did long, long forgotten, but he did a couple that were memorable and amazingly life changing. For example, he showed us a rope, flexible rope, and he said that he was going to perform a miracle. He was going to make that rope defied gravity, and he said he was going to do it with a magic chemical. So he reached into his pocket for that invisible magic chemical that he sprinkled on the rope. And believe it or not, that rope defied gravity. I didn't know how that was happening. And I thought, you know, if I try to do it, that's what would happen because I didn't have any magic chemical. But what really intrigued me was why he had used those words. Why not abracadabra or hocus pocus or alakazam? Why magic chemical? So I went to the school library. I took out a book on chemistry, took out a book on magic, have followed both of those. And of course, there's a very interesting juxtaposition of of those two because the same way that when you watch a magic trick, you try to figure out how it's happening, when you watch a chemical reaction, you try to figure out what on earth is is is happening. Chemical reactions can be very impressive like that one. You want to see that again. They always do. No matter whether you're doing this for kindergarten kids or you're doing this for medical doctors, they always want to see things burn or blow up. Well, that's pretty amazing. And it looks like magic. But of course it isn't magic. It is chemistry because what we have here is paper that has been treated with sulfuric acid and nitric acid. Paper is mostly made of cellulose. So what we now have is Nitro cellulose. The Nitro groups release oxygen, and of course you need oxygen for combustion. The reason that it burns so effectively is because such a dramatic amount of oxygen is suddenly released and it's enough to burn the paper. So now you understand the science. Now you see what happens. No longer magic. We've taken out the magic, replace it with science. So that's one reason I like to start with Charles Dickens, but there is another which is much more appropriate for our context today, and that is one of his most famous books, Oliver Twist. Some of you may have read it in in high school because it very often is one of the assigned readings. Or you may have seen the musical version or the movie of of Oliver. Well, the story is about orphans in an orphanage who are hungry all the time. They're not given enough food. And they sing and they sing about food and glorious food, and they dream about having enough food to eat. And whenever the attendant brings in luscious food, they look at it, but it's not for them. It's all for the people who run this, this orphanage. And all these poor little boys can do is look on because they don't get any of that. What they get is gruel. That is their meal. And they don't even get enough of that. And Oliver, if you recall, is punished for asking, Sir, can I have some more gruel? Well, what was gruel? Gruel is what today we would call porridge or oatmeal. And no longer is it a food that we look on as a cheap commodity to to feed to orphans. It actually has taken on the mantle of being a health food for various reasons that we will come back to. But one is that oatmeal contains a lot of fiber. Fiber is the part of plants that we cannot digest. We have enzymes in our digestive tract that can breakdown proteins, breakdown carbohydrates, breakdown fats, but they cannot breakdown certain components of plants and that is what we call fiber. Fiber is healthy for various reasons. It allows stuff to go through the colon quickly so that there are less problems with toxins staying behind in in in the colon. Also, some forms of fiber serve as food for bacteria in the gut that then churn out their metabolites like like short chain fatty acids, which improve immune function and have other kinds of health benefits. Well, the kind of fiber that we have in oatmeal is known as beta glucan. It's a carbohydrate. It's made of glucose molecules joined together in in a chain and it cannot be digested. So it builds up in the colon where it absorbs a lot of water and becomes a gelatinous material. And this gelatinous material can absorb cholesterol and can also take in bile acids. The bile acids are secreted by the liver and the pancreas in order to to to digest foods and they end up in in the colon. Now generally any bile acid or cholesterol that ends up in the colon is reabsorbed into the system. However, when you have a lot of fiber like beta glucan, the bile acid and the cholesterol are absorbed and they go out of the body. Cholesterol is an essential biochemical. The body needs it for various processes, so it has to make it, and if it isn't reabsorbed from the colon, more has to be made by by the liver. And this is done through a series of chemical reactions where cholesterol is eventually converted into bile acids, which are essential biochemicals. Anyway, the bottom line is that when you eat oatmeal and you have a lot of beta glucan, you will end up reducing the level of cholesterol in your blood because the cholesterol is not reabsorbed from the gut and the body has to to make more of it. But in total, you didn't then have less floating around in your bloodstream. Now oats are are interesting not only in terms of oatmeal, but there are many other products that have become popular recently, things like oat milk. Well, it really should not be called oat milk because milk by definition is the stuff that comes from a cow. It's really should be called oat drink or oat beverage. But the producers of course like to use the term oat milk because it suggests that it is equivalent to milk and that of course will boost sales. Well, there is some fiber that is present left in, in, in oat milk and not as much, of course, as in the solid oats, but there is some in oat milk. As you can see, it's about 1g, which is not, not, not a whole lot. And the question is, how do you make this oat milk? You can try it at home. It's actually a very simple thing to do. All you have to do is take some oats, put them in a blender, add water and grind for about 30 seconds. That's it. And then you will take us some gauze or cheesecloth and filter it out and presto, you have oat milk. It's really very easy to to make, but the 32nd is quite critical because if you overdo that you will get what we call gelatinization. Oats of course contain starch. Starch has 2 forms, amylose and amylopectin. They're both glucose molecules in the chain. The difference is the branching in the chain. And what happens if you blend this starch too much? You get something called gelatinization. The grains of of of starch burst open and the starch molecules then are released into the water. Now, this is exactly what you see happening when you're cooking and you're trying to thicken a Stew or a sauce. You add some starch, right? And that thickens it. But the same thing happens here. But when you're making old beverages, you don't want that. So that's the basic process. And they've become very popular. They're, you know, you have all, all kinds of versions. And it's interesting to look at some of the labels. And of course we will do a lot of looking at labels because we want to know what it is that is in our food supply. And if you look at one of these and you can see sunflower oil and that's because the oats contain very little fat. So in order to make it taste more like milk, you have to add some sort of fat. It can be any kind of oil oil, soy oil is very often added, can be called canola, sunflower, etcetera. Something else that is is is is pretty interesting. If you notice on on the label here, you see where it says organic, natural flavors. I'll come back to that in a second. If you look at the sugar content of this one, it has seven grams. If you look at the sugar content of this oat beverage, it has no sugar at all. So what is going on here? Because we did not see sugar listed on the label of the previous one. How can it contain 7 grams of sugar? Because what we saw listed there was natural flavors. Well, sugar is a natural substance extracted from the sugar cane. So that's what they calling a natural flavor in order to avoid using the word sugar on the label because people are trying to stay away from sugar these days. Justifiably, some of these old beverages will also contain an enzyme called amylase. Amylase breaks down starch that prevents gelatinization. So there's a lot of technology that goes into this, but I mean, the the question is why have these things become popular? Why are people using oat milk instead of drinking milk? Well, there are some reasons for that. There are people who are lactose intolerant that is they get I'll when they consume lactose, which is the sugar that is found in milk, you get upset stomach, diarrhea, etcetera. So of course old products don't have any any lactose. Then there are those people who prefer vegetarian products. Obviously milk is not not bad and old beverages are. There's some people who are concerned about the treatment of cows and indeed, if you've ever been to a modern dairy, it's not the the picture that you see. You know, when, when with cows grazing out and fields of grass. That's not how it is these days. This is what it looks like automatic milking machines. The cows are are fed food that is properly rationed. It certainly doesn't mean that they're unhappy. I mean, they're, they're well treated, but you know, a lot of people don't like the idea that that the cows are basically converted into industrial machines. And then there are people who are concerned about the effects of milk on health. And I'm sure you've seen if you cruise the Internet and all of you do, I mean, I know you TikTok and Instagram and God knows what else. And you come across all of these kind of things telling you the horrors of certain foods, including milk about, you know, how the human is the only animal that drinks milk past the age of weaning, you know, implying that that this is the wrong thing to do. But I mean, of course, the human is also the only animal that has a brain has designed computers, has gone to the moon. We have enough knowledge about food to know that it's OK to drink, drink milk. But there are all these horror stories. But of course, what we do and what will be the emphasis in this course is the scientific evidence. We look at the scientific literature. So for example, here's a study. It's a meta analysis. A meta analysis is a study of studies. So what they do is they've put together all of the studies that have been done on the health effects of milk, including every possible connection as you can see from from effects on on on the nervous system, effects on the skeleton, etcetera. So this is really a compendium of dozens and dozens of studies. And the end result is that the benefits of drinking milk outweigh the detriments, except of course, if you have certain situations like lactose intolerance or milk allergy. Milk allergy is not the same as lactose intolerance. It's an allergy to proteins in in the milk. So anyway, as as you can see it's quite comforting, but just about every scientific paper ends with asking for more research. As you can see the last sentence here, more well designed studies are are are needed and you see this in every scientific paper. No one is ever able to come to 100% conclusion because that's just the way science is what we should always do. And what I always do when I take a look at a paper is before reading any further, I go to the end to see where the funding came from because funding can influence the content of a of a paper. So in this case it wasn't funded by the dairy industry, it was independently funded. So we can pretty well rely on the information. Now. Just because some study is funded by a vested interest doesn't negate the study, it just means that you want to look at it more carefully. I think the biggest concern is studies that are not published which have been funded by some agency that would have something to gain by the results of that study. Because of the results are not favorable, it doesn't get get published. That's a a bigger concern. Anyway. There are studies about everything. The scientific literature is voluminous. There are about 5 scientific studies in the peer reviewed literature published every single minute of every day, 365 days a year. In just one hour. You can gather studies about anything you know by by looking at the Internet. Study about raw milk, for example. You know, they, they will vilify this. They will, they, they will in this particular case, tell you that pasteurized milk is dead milk. I mean, this is just absurd. And unfortunately, this is the kind of nonsense that we have to deal with these days because Robert F Kennedy, junior scientifically illiterate character has in some bizarre fashion, become US Secretary of Health. It's very difficult to explain how this can happen, how really a scientific lunatic can be at the head of such an an agency. He is in favor of, of of raw milk. The fact is that raw milk is dangerous. There are no benefits to be hell had from drinking raw milk. There are only dangers to be had. Pasteurization just means treating the milk with heat for a very short period of time to kill bacteria. We don't want those bacteria in in in our body and any suggestion that raw milk has some sort of property that is destroyed by pasteurization is not true. On the other hand, I I don't want to leave the dairy industry blame free either because they also go overboard with their advertising, you know, implying that milk is essential to life and that we should be drinking or consuming 3 dairy servings every day. There's no justification for that either. Milk is fine, but it's not necessary. You can have a proper diet without ever consuming any dairy products for example. You can compare Dairy Milk at the top, oat milk at the bottom, and you can also look at all the other milks and you can see that the nutritional profile of oat milk and Dairy Milk is essentially the same. Now it's true that Dairy Milk will have some calcium that is naturally occurring and oat milk calcium is added, but that doesn't matter as far as your body is is concerned. So you can certainly design any of these nut beverages really shouldn't be called milks to be equivalent to to dairy. If you do want an argument against dairy and why you should be consuming vegetable based beverages, you can find an argument in terms of the environment here. There's no question when it comes to water use, when it comes to to the use of pesticides, when it comes to the greenhouse effect, there's no question that raising animals has a much bigger impact. Raising animals is not an environmentally friendly business because you have to raise the crops to feed the animals, you have to transport the the, the animals. There's a lot of greenhouse impact. So if you are really environmentally conscious, you can of course resort to vegetarian products, which will have a smaller impact. But when you go into your Starbucks and you pay the your ridiculous, whatever it is, 5 or $6 for a cup of coffee and ask them to put oat milk in it instead of regular milk, don't think that you're getting some sort of a nutritional advantage. And yet that's what the marketing is, is all about because it's a lot cheaper than regular milk. But as I said, there's no health benefit here, but there is the environmental advantage if you want to be concerned about that. What we are really concerned about in this course is what we should eat, right. I mean that this this is something that we think about all the time and we should think about it all the time because food is the only raw material that ever goes into our body. So we are in fact constructed of the food that we eat. So it is obvious that food has an impact on health. But we get advice from everywhere. Eat this, don't eat that. I mean, it's, you know, especially when you go on the Internet, I mean, you get this advice all the time and it's not only on the on the Internet. Listen, if if you're not going to stay in class, don't come. OK, you're not required to come, but if you're going to leave, don't come. All right there. There are publications all the time about food. New Scientist is actually an excellent publication. I would suggest that if you ever read just one scientific publication, that's that's the one. But there are all kinds. I mean, you see them all over the place, right? You see demonizing of ultra process foods, demonizing of milk, as I said, all kinds of things. And the studies just keep coming. You can go to Harvard website and they'll build a healthy eating plant for you. Then you can come across a paper about berries and about all the good that they can do or multivitamins, whether or not they have any effect on on memory. I mean, just goes on and on. There are new weight loss drugs coming out all the time. And of course, we will address those questions about supplements. Should you take fish oil supplements? Does sugar have an impact on Alzheimer's disease? And what about an artificial sweetener like erythritol? What impact does does that have? The studies keep coming and people start asking questions about them justifiably. Last week there were a number of studies that came out interesting about heavy metals and ulcerative colitis, about the vitamin E and its benefits, about nitrates present in in vegetables, nitrates present in hot dogs. All of these things we will we'll discuss and whether or not unsaturated fatty acids are a problem. And once again, Kennedy thinks that they are, and he tells us that instead we should be eating beef tallow, which is absolutely idiotic, but that's what happens when you have an idiot in charge. One of the interesting studies that came out just a couple of days ago was this one which the media really seized upon eating cheese and whether or not it is linked to reduce risk of dementia. This was all over the Internet and it was a report about a study that was, you know, properly carried out study where they investigated thousands of people who had been what filled up food frequency questionnaires and then were followed. And based upon those food frequency questionnaires, they came to the conclusion that people who ate 50 grams or more of high fat cheese a day had a somewhat reduced risk of dementia. Now, you have to be very careful with studies like this because there's so many confounders. You know, the question is what else were they doing? Were they exercising more? Were they eating more fruits and vegetables? Whatever anyway. There's not much attention that should be paid to to to to this. First of all, the results were barely statistically significant. But what happens I I get someone calling me up and asking if they should be eating a grilled cheese sandwich every day because it does contain 50 grams of of high fat cheese. It Is this going to reduce the risk of dementia? Well, of course not, that would be an improper interpretation of the study. And furthermore, nobody would for 25 years eat a grilled cheese sandwich every day, so that would be totally unrealistic. If you enjoy a grilled cheese sandwich, by all means eat it. Not for every meal. Don't think that it's going to reduce your risk of of of dementia. But there's some interesting science here too, if you want to know how to make it properly, because there are proper and improper ways to make a grilled cheese sandwich. There's a lot of science there. First of all, forget the sliced white bread that's not to be eaten. You want to find a good sourdough bread, coat it on the outside of the two two breads with a little bit of butter and little bit of mayonnaise, into which you sprinkled some Parmesan cheese. Inside you put cheddar cheese, not, not the yellow American cheese, proper cheddar cheese, and add a little bit of Parmesan there too. You can't make a grilled cheese sandwich with Parmesan only because it will not melt properly. But if you add a bit of parmesan to the cheddar cheese, it will tickle your taste buds. All right. So then you put it into a pan, which has to be low or medium heat, not high heat, because if you put it on high heat, the the bread will burn before the cheese melts. So you have to have just the right meat, the right temperature in order to get the proper grilled cheese sandwich. 3 minutes and you flip it. The second side will take only two minutes. The outside will be really crisp because it the sprinkling of the Parmesan cheese that you put on there will make it crispy. Of course, you have to use the real Parmesan cheese that comes from Parma in Italy, Parmesan Reggiano, not not some strange cheese that that you can sprinkle and you try that. You got a perfect grilled cheese sandwich. So there's your bit of homework. You can do some chemistry and you can report next time. And when you've made your grilled cheese sandwich, take a look at it to see if there are any images in the toast. In this case, a lady, after biting into the sandwich, discovered that she saw the image of the Virgin Mary in the cheese in the in the in the crust of the bread. If you stretch your imagination a little bit, you can kind of see a face there. And believe it or not, she was able to sell this on eBay for $28,000. It was bought by an online casino who used it in some sort of some form of advertising. So take a look at your grilled cheese sandwich. If there's an image in there, it could be very profitable. Now, around the world, people eat all kinds of foods. So there are sick people and healthy people everywhere. So it's virtually impossible to say that any single diet is the best diet. But there are features of the diet, as you will see, that that we can recommend. But there are strange diets. I mean, you know, if you go to China, there are some very strange things. When when Elon Musk was a visitor in China, he was treated at a banquet. This was the menu at the banquet. What did it have? Italian black vinegar, pork neck meat, jellyfish, head and seafood sauce, sweet and sour flavour. Bagel, cuttlefish, pickled cabbage, Geo duck, whatever that means. Shrimp balls. I don't think they're talking about shrimp testicles. They're talking about shrimp being made into balls and, and, and, and fried. This is not the kind of thing that we would eat here. But I guess, you know, they were very happy with this meal there. Of course, what we have to think about is what we should eat and what is available to to us. And the fact is that there's a tremendous amount of food that is available to us here in North America. We have an abundance of food and basically an embarrassing abundance. 1/3 of the food that is produced in the Western world gets thrown out. 1/3 of the world goes to bed hungry every night. So there is enough food, it's just not properly distributed. Well, what should we eat? It can be summarized very easily and Canada's Food Guide has actually done that. Half your plate should be fruits and vegetables, 1/4 of the plate whole grains, and 1/4 of the plain protein. Protein does not necessarily mean meat. There's protein in beans, there's protein in lentils, there's protein in in in soy. It is certainly possible to meet your protein needs without eating any meat. And of course we will talk about all the different diets. Well, how do we know this? I mean, how do we make such recommendations? It comes from the scientific literature. It comes from the peer reviewed literature. And that's the altar at which we in the world of science worship. Sometimes a bit too much. Because peer review does not mean ironclad. It does not mean that there cannot be errors. For example, that dreadful paper by Andrew Wakefield that first linked autism to vaccination was published in The Lancet, one of the prime journals in the world. It was eventually retracted, but what happened here? When a scientist sends in a paper that they intend to be published in the journal, the editor sends it out to what we call referees who are experts in the field, who will look at the paper and decide whether it merits publication. They will often ask questions, they will ask for parts of it to be redone, rewritten. There's a lot of back and forth. Eventually a decision is made. However, you have to understand that the referees cannot attempt to reproduce the work because this is often the work of of many people over years. So when you get a paper to referee, you have to assume that what was written there is what was actually done and that the results were properly interpreted. If someone is going to lie, cheat, or be fraudulent as Wakefield did, you're not going to catch that until someone tries to duplicate the work. Wakefield was trying to manufacture his own vaccine and therefore to demonize all other vaccines, fraudulent data. And unfortunately, this precipitated the fear about vaccination and started measles epidemics that we hadn't seen for decades. There are many people, of course, who are out there standing on soapboxes, giving out all kinds of information. And this is where you have to be careful in terms of to whom we listen, whether it's nutritional information or or anything else, because the quacks are very often very good at what they do. Quacks are people who pretend to or think that they have knowledge that they don't actually have. And there's many of them, and they're not always easy to recognize. For example, Vani Harry, who has anointed herself as the food babe. She made-up that name for herself, which already tells you something about her. Anyway, she rose to fame by saying that if you can't pronounce it, you should not be eating it. Well, I'm sure if I were to confront her with beta fructofuranosol, alpha D glucopuranoside, she would be horrified and run in the opposite direction. But that is just a chemical term for sugar. Now, there are many reasons to cut back on our intake of sugar, but the fact that it has a multisyllabic chemical name that is hard to pronounce is not one of them. What is frightening, though, is that people like this have somehow been regarded as as influencers and experts, and they are on the stage, sometimes together with real experts. Here's a situation where Vanny Harry, who has no science background whatsoever, was on the stage being interviewed together with Marty Mccurry, who is a very legitimate Dr. He's the head of the FDA in the US. There are some skeletons in his closet too, but at least he is a legitimate scientist and she should not be anywhere near him in terms of of opinion. Why should we be, you know, taking advice from this this woman anyway, as, as you can imagine, I get very annoyed by stuff like that. So I ended up sending her a couple of books to read, but I doubt that I I didn't get any thanks from her. But I think even these probably were a bit too difficult for her to to understand. Now, sometimes you have to give begrudging credit to the quacks. They are very good at what they do. They have learned to cloak themselves in the garb of science. They know how to spell scientific information. They can sound very convincing. And it's going to be very hard to argue with them. It's it's difficult to overturn their cockamamie ideas. And they are just so voluminous. They're absolutely everywhere. And they are out there, you know, very often spouting their nonsense about what we should worry about, what we should avoid. We need to learn enough science to avoid this kind of BS. And of course, we will try to do that. Now, sometimes the BS is, is, is very apparent. For example, do we really need a warning on a bin of peanuts telling us that this product contains peanuts? I mean, you know, sometimes the nonsense is pretty easy to recognize. Otherwise, not so easy. For example, you can go into a health food store and see some aerobic oxygen. I don't know where you would go to find an aerobic oxygen. But anyway, you go to find aerobic oxygen here and the attendant will tell you that we're putting so many pollutants into the atmosphere that is destroying the oxygen content, and we are being starved of oxygen. So we have to buy this product, put a few drops into a glass of water which will release oxygen, drink that and you'll be fine. Of course, this is total nonsense. Yes, there is pollution, but it has nothing to do with the oxygen content of the atmosphere. That has been the same for millennia. What this contains is a smidgen of potassium chlorate, which can release oxygen. Trivial amount. The amount that you oxygen you would get here would be less than what you would inhale in one breath. And furthermore, putting oxygen into your stomach doesn't do any good. We breathe through our lungs, not through our our gut. So this is absolute nonsense. And then the same attendant may guide you to the next aisle where they have a bunch of antioxidants and they want to sell you that, not recognizing the irony of the situation that on the one hand they want to sell you oxygen and the other hand they want to sell you antioxidants. The nonsense is is everywhere. You can buy dehydrated water. Well, the fact is that that actually is a joke item, but I'm sure I could find someone to whom it could be sold. This, on the other hand, is not a joke item. Apple cider vinegar and there's nothing wrong with apple cider vinegar may make for a tasty salad dressing. However, it does not cure all of the diseases there that it claims to to cure. But you can see why people may gravitate towards this because they see claims that apple cider vinegar will clean out your arteries. And, you know, and I think people know that they may not be eating the right things and that their arteries may have some crud or sludge in them because they're out there, you know, eating the Triple Bypass Burger and its relatives. And if you want to try that one, you have to go to Las Vegas and go to the Heart Attack Grill where as you can see, there's always an ambulance standing by to cart away. The people have heart attacks inside from consuming the high fat foods. And inside you will be given, instead of regular bibs, you'll be given hospital gowns. It's quite a gimmick. And the nurses serve as waitresses. All right. So it's it's sort of a interesting place. And now they have gone past the Triple Bypass Burger to the Quadruple Bypass Burger, which has a stunning total of 9980 calories. Consider that you should be consuming about 2000 calories a day. That's a pretty heavy load. So the Heart Attack Grill is aptly named because if you would consume that kind of food regularly, your risk of heart attack of course goes up. So people of course retort and say, well, no, I don't want that. I don't want those fatty burgers. Give me the Impossible or the Beyond Meat burger, which are made from vegetable sources. These have become very popular, actually unjustifiably, because when you take a look at their nutritional content, the first thing that you'll notice that they are in fact higher in salt than the regular burger. These are highly processed products. Fat content is is roughly the same. I mean, there's really nothing to make you eat this unless you really are environmentally concerned and don't want animal products. But if you, you know, look at the salt content for, for example, see that it is dramatically more than regular burger. So, you know, people say, I, you know, I don't want to eat the burger. But then others, like Doctor William Davis, who amazingly is a cardiologist, says, no, don't worry about the burger. Worry about the bun, because the bun contains gluten, and that's the real poison. Well, the fact is that we've done a lot of scientific studies and aside from people who have celiac disease who really do have to stay away from from gluten, there is no concern for the general population. But you'll find these kind of books, you know, in bookstores and online terrifying us about all kinds of foods. We've talked about the milk. They will tell you you shouldn't consume it, that oils are are are toxic. You can't have soy either because it contains hormones. And of course, beef is no good. It's high in, in fat. Sugar is a sweet poison, but you can't replace it with artificial sweeteners because those will kill you too. And basically, you can't eat. That's the conclusion that you know you can come to if you just listen to all of this stuff. And if you in fact don't abide by those rules, then you better go and detox yourself by buying some kind of detox supplement, which is totally absurd. Our body is equipped with our liver and kidneys, which are the detoxing organs. So any time that you see detox on a product, you know that this is just nonsense. So it's not surprising that people are confused and, you know, perplexed because there's so much confusing information. One day we're told that butter contains saturated fat. That's what's killing us. We should be eating margarine because that contains unsaturated fats, and then we find out that it's actually margin that's killing us because those unsaturated fats are contaminated with trans fats, which are worse than saturated fats. The fact is that you can find a scientific study to promote any food or to vilify any food. For example, you can find studies that tell you that tomatoes cause cancer or they prevent cancer. And so it goes with all of the other foods listed here except for one, bacon. You can't find a study that says that bacon is good for you. Maybe you can, I don't know, Maybe I haven't looked hard enough. But the others, you know, you can find other way. Now, how can it be with tomatoes? How can tomatoes both prevent cancer or cause cancer? Well, the argument here is about the pesticides that are used. And indeed pesticides are used on crops and some pesticides are used on on tomatoes. And it's true that some pesticides in staggeringly high doses when given to animals can cause cancer, but that doesn't mean that the trace amounts that are found on on food are are a problem. But anyway, that's the argument of how tomatoes are supposedly causing cancer. How do they prevent cancer? Well, because they contain compounds like lycopene and various carotenoids that are effective antioxidants, which indeed have cancer preventative properties. So eating is a very confusing experience. It wasn't always the case. In fact, you know when when I was growing up to the few years ago, the only thing that mattered was what food tasted like. If it tasted good, you ate. It didn't matter, you know, you didn't think about, you know, the nutrition. Today we scrutinize everything. You want to know what's in that hot dog? Is it preserved with nitrites? How much salt is is there in it? We expect nutritional advice from waiters in restaurants about the nutritional content of of food. Now there's nothing wrong with that because as I said before, we are what we eat, right? We we are nothing more than a big bag of chemicals. That's what the human body is. Now I know some of you think that chemicals are only found in flats in the laboratories, but chemical is not a dirty word. Everything in the world is made-up of chemicals that just the basic building blocks of all matter. But how do we know what the effect of these chemicals on us is going to be, whether they're synthetic, natural, whatever. What is the effect? We know it because we also are what we read, right? This is how we gain knowledge. This is how science works. We read the peer reviewed literature. We come to some decisions. But of course, it's not only the peer reviewed literature that people read. They read newspapers and here, of course, the advice can be questionable. One day we find out that poutine is a killer. Well, you know what poutine is. It's this Quebec delicacy. French fries fried in in saturated fat with some fatty cheese on top, all topped off with some gravy of unknown etiology. But it kind of tastes good, usually because it is so, so salty. So we get, you know, all this information about stuff that we shouldn't eat, but then you can also pick up some newspaper that will have the the alternate orientation telling us what we should eat, what miracle foods there are that are going to make us live forever. For example, in this particular case, it was pomegranates. OK, pomegranate foods price is biblical times for their healing and a anti aging properties. Well, just because something has been prized for a long time does not mean that it has scientific basis, right. Just because something is around for a long time doesn't mean that that that that it has been beneficial for a long time. But in the in the case of of this pomegranate, it's it's an interesting way to get into a little story here because, you know, they claim that it's been Christ is biblical times. So let's go back to the days of the of the Bible. And if you remember the story of of of of Genesis, Eve offered Adam what we have no biblical scholars here. The usual answer to that question is an apple. Whatever she offered, if indeed she did, it wasn't an apple because apples did not grow in that part of the world until much, much later. The reason we think it was an apple is because that's the way artists in the Middle Ages portrayed it, because that's the fruit that they knew. And of course, the Bible doesn't say apple. The Bible says fruit of the tree of knowledge. It does not name what it was. What was it? It could have been a pomegranate because pomegranates did grow in that part of the world since Time Memorial. And interestingly enough, pomegranates contain compounds called aromatase inhibitors. And these aromatase inhibitors actually do impede the multiplication of cancer cells in the lab. If you go into the lab and you take cultured breast cancer cells and bait them in pomegranate juice, they will multiply less quickly. What does that mean? It means that if you go to the lab and they cultured breast cancer cells and bait them in pomegranate juice, they multiply less quickly. That's all it means. You cannot extrapolate from that into what may happen to humans. That needs a lot more work. Unless, of course, you are selling some pomegranate product. Then you can claim that you can cheat death with it, that it's a superhero or it's a doctor, and that it can put you on life support. Well, you can take information out of context and make all kinds of claims. For example, in the foothills of the Himalayas, they have a diet where they eat a lot of dried apricots. Why? Because that's what they have. I suspect they would rather eat AT bone steak and French fries and coleslaw, but that's not what they have available now. Interesting enough, this is also the part of the world where James Hilton located his classic novel Lost Horizon, which tells the story of this mythical Shangri-La where people live for very impressive lengths of time. Of course, there may be people in that area who look like they have lived for a long time. I mean, he may only be 39 years old, but there's, you know, tough life there in the Himalayas. But you can take this out of context and say, well, look, these people have impressive longevity. They eat a lot of of of apricots. Apricots contain a lot of beta carotene, which in the body converts to vitamin A. And vitamin A is essential for the immune system. So therefore you should be out buying all kinds of supplements. And if you can't buy the vitamin A or beta carotene supplements, you should at least eat a lot of carrots because they contain a lot of beta carotene. So you know, by by selectively referring to information, you can create a story that is very believable, but it's quite nonsense. Or you can go in the other direction. You can create fear as well. Most of us would agree that eating an apple is beneficial, right? That's it's a healthy food. I mean, you've heard stories about an apple a day keeping the doctor away maybe if you throw it at him or her. But in any case, what are you really tasting when you bite into that apple? This is what you're really eating. These are not additives. They're not pesticide residues. These are the building blocks of that apple with some, you know, pretty interesting chemicals. For example, acetone. Well, the last time you encountered acetone was likely on the label of your nail Polish remover where it says do not drink. Good advice. Acetone can be highly toxic. Also in that apple is formaldehyde. You know what formaldehyde is? That's the substance embalmers used to preserve dead bodies. It's a preservative. It also happens to be carcinogenic. It's there in your apple, and if that rubs you the wrong way, there's some rubbing alcohol in there as well. Rubbing alcohol or isopropanol is found in your apple. So by this time you're getting the message that when you're biting into that apple, that apple is actually taking a bite out of you. Of course, this is all nonsense, even though what I said is perfectly true. Acetone is there, formaldehyde is there, rubbing alcohol is there, But in vanishing the small amounts, and this is critical. This is one of the most important features of science, first voiced by Paracelsus way back in the 16th century. Only the dose makes the poison. Whenever you hear any talk or read anything about something being toxic, what you have to ask is how much are we exposed to and how does that relate to a dose that is known to be toxic? And the only way we know that is by reference to the peer reviewed literature. All right, that's where we get our our information. Not by hearsay, but long before there was peer reviewed literature, people were of course interested in health. I mean, if we go back over 2000 years to the type of time of Hippocrates, he supposedly said let thy food be thy medicine. You see this quote from him in in virtually every textbook of nutrition. Although when you actually try to to look to see if there's any evidence that they ever said that you, there's nothing in the Hippocratic writings. He may have said this anyway, but he also said that lettuce cools the body and curbs the passion, which of course is total nonsense. He also said pigeon droppings are great for baldness. As you can see from his personal evidence, they don't work very well. But mercifully you didn't eat them. You would just rub them on the bald head. But he also did say that flax is great for the intestines, which is true. Flax seeds do have all kinds of benefits. So they contain omega-3 fats, which we will learn about lignans, which have anti cancer properties, fiber, which I already told you is is is beneficial. So flax seeds indeed are are healthy and we know this because they have been studied in this particular study by Lillian Thompson, University of Toronto, Canada's second best university found that diet high in flaxseed, which was incorporated to muffins, 25 grams of flax in muffins prevented a recurrence of breast cancer in patients who had been treated for breast cancer. This of course generated headlines in the media about this compound that can prevent cancer and save lives. But if you read the details of the study, yes, there was an effect in overweight premenopausal women. So not in everybody. So you've got to look, you know, at the information in, in detail. And Hippocrates was right about some things about, you know, flaxseed being good, wrong about many other things. Nutritional information back then was a mix of sense and nonsense. And unfortunately, so it is today, except that today we have the scientific knowledge to know what is sensible and and what is not. But people want miracles. They want the goose that lays the golden egg. Well, that only happens in fairy tales. There are no geese that lay golden eggs there. There's no wonder products. There are no no miracles. There are some chickens that lay golden eggs, at least as far as the farmer is concerned. If those eggs are omega-3 eggs because they can be sold for a much, much higher price. Because people believe that Omega threes are beneficial, which in some cases they can be. Not in eggs because there's not enough in there. How do they get any omega-3 in there? They feed the chickens flaxseed and flaxseed contains small amounts of omega-3 fats, but not enough to have any kind of of impact. Why did they do this? Why have they come up with omega-3 eggs to try to give eggs a more healthy Halo. Unfortunately, eggs have been much vilified because the yolk of the egg contains cholesterol and cholesterol of course, has been implicated in in heart disease and therefore people have been staying away from from eggs. The truth is that while cholesterol levels in your blood are indeed a risk factor for heart disease, they are not a reflection of the amount of cholesterol that you eat. That has very little impact. However, the fat that you eat is what drives up blood cholesterol. And of course we will look at that in in in greater detail. So yes, indeed, blood cholesterol is a risk factor. And any time that there's any kind of scientific study that comes out that shows that you can lower your blood cholesterol, people of course will jump on it, such as in this case here where beta glucan, the substance that we already encountered in oats, was linked to reduce cholesterol in the blood. So all of a sudden, Old Brand, which is the outer covering of the oat, which used to be a garbage product, it was just given to horses as food. So now all of a sudden they took it out of the mouths of horses. They put it on our breakfast plates. What did that leave for the horses? So they were eating Garfrosted flakes. We were eating the Old Brand. Old Brand Mania was on the way. All kinds of products had Old Brand added to them. Dirty potato chips, bring them on as long as they contain old brand. People thought that all their dietary sins would be forgiven if they would just squeeze some old brand into their life. But of course, the same way that we ask the question how much when it comes to toxicity, we also ask the question how much when it comes to potential benefit. So we would ask the question, all right, so old brand, yes, it contains this beta glucan which can lower cholesterol by the mechanism that we earlier described. How much of this stuff do you have to choke down in order to have any effect? Well, we know the answer to that. You need about 3 grams of beta glucan to budget your cholesterol level, not significantly, but to have any kind of effect. Then of course, the next question is how much oat brand do you have to eat to get the three grams of beta glucan? And we know this about 1 cup of oat bran cereal. This is not one of God's gifts to the palate. If any of you ever eaten just straight oat bran, you know that that you got to dress it up somehow. You got to add berries or something to it to make it that palatable. It's doable with some difficulty. Or you can have old brand muffins, but it would take three to five muffins to give you the 3 grams of beta glucan and by that time you would be overdosing on sugar. Or you could have oatmeal, 1 1/2 cups. That is very doable. It indeed that makes for a good breakfast, especially if you dress it up with some berries. Anyway, when this first came out, all of a sudden General Mills, the makers of Cheerios discovered that the old and Cheerios stands for Old Brand. Before that they didn't even consider what they were actually making Cheerios from, but now they started promoting it because of the beta glucan. The fact is that you'd have to eat 5 servings of Cheerios in order to to get your 3 grams of beta glucan, and even for Cheerio lovers, that is a bit excessive. Oatmeal is the easiest way to get your 3 grams of of beta glucan and dress it up with some berries. It's it's, it's great. It has sound science behind it, but there are so many publications out there that don't have sound science behind them. All of these about nutritional prescription either way, illness, whatever fit for life diet. I like to pick on this one because it's been around for over 20 years and it comes off and on of of best seller list. It was written by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond, a married couple who had no scientific background whatsoever and they have since divorced. Each one of them married someone half their age. Interesting. Anyway, I first heard about them in this class. Actually, it was more than 20 years ago. I'd say it was probably 30 years ago when a student came up to me with an index card handwritten that she had copied out of the book. This was the paragraph that she had copied out of the book. Within atoms and molecules reside divided elements. We know it's enzymes, enzymes or nothings or substances or life principle atoms and molecules. I really live in the cell and she was asking for my opinion on on this. I looked at this and I thought this a joke. I thought someone had sat down and said to themselves, what is the greatest amount of nonsense that can be put into the fewest words? This is a candidate for that. Molecules are made of of atoms. They don't have any spiritual ability. They are just things. They they, they don't have any thoughts, processes. Enzymes are not things or substances. Of course there are things or substances. Enzymes are just protein molecules, nothing magical about them. You can put them in a jar. You can have them on your shop. They're they're not the life principle in atoms and and and molecules. This is absolute nonsense. And then I got the book I want to read some more nonsense. It's always enjoyable. And so I find this the greatest threat to your health is processed food. Today science entered the food industry was a sad day indeed. No, it wasn't. The day science entered the food industry meant that we could preserve foods for longer time either by refrigeration or or with preservatives, That we knew that we could add iodine to food to prevent thyroid problems, that we could fortify foods with various vitamins and and minerals. But anyway, there are issues about ultra processed foods, which of course we will address, but in their view. The greatest threat to health is processed food. And they pointed a finger specifically at sliced white bread. Now, I'm not going to tell you that this bread is good. Of course that isn't. We should be eating whole grain bread. But their argument was that it contains preservatives and that's why it should not be consumed. Well, yes, it does contain preservatives because if it wouldn't within a couple of days, that's what it would look like. And scientific studies have shown that people do not buy that kind of bread, and indeed they should not because molds contain legitimate toxic substances. This is the reason why sliced white bread contains A preservative and that is calcium propionate. Calcium propionate, like any other food additive has to pass through all kinds of of hurdles through Health Canada, FDA in the US before it is allowed as an additive. Not a problem in case of calcium propionate because it actually is a natural occurring chemical in our body. We sweat propionates, our underarm secretions actually contain propionates. These are metabolic byproducts of the fat that we eat, which may also explain the reason that the traditional Frenchman carries his baguette home under his arm, because they don't use preservatives in baguette flour in France, because the baguettes are eaten almost before you get home, right? And in this case, use some natural preservative from your underarm secretions. Anyway, when you talk about the French, you have to address the French paradox. How is it that the coronary artery disease rate in France, it's 1/4 that in North America. The French eat the buttery croissants, they eat those fatty cheeses, they eat the liver of geese that had been stuffed. How is it that they have a lower risk of heart disease? Well, the French, believe it or not, watch more Jerry Lewis movies per capita than any other population in the world. So you could say that watching Jerry Lewis movies reduces the risk of heart disease. Obviously correlation is not the same as causation. Just because they do one thing and see something else doesn't mean that the two are related. This is one of the biggest problems that we see in people who don't really understand science is that they mistake correlation for causation. For example, when you take a look at German statistics, you find that the birth rate has decreased very significantly, and so has the stork population. Storks. Basically, I've moved out of cities because of of pollution. But as you can see, there's this relationship between storks and birth rate. Are we going to conclude that therefore it is true that storks bring babies? Of course not. So correlation is not the same as causation. Now when we get back to the French, OK, I mean, we can dismiss the idea of watching movies lowers the risk of heart disease, but what about the fact that they consume 30 times as much wine as we do in North America? Is that a possible connection? Could that reduce the risk of heart disease? Well, before we start giving alcohol to our kids, we better have a more careful look here. Look into wine. Is there something to this? Well indeed, wine does contain a compound called resveratrol. And resveratrol in some animal studies has in fact shown to have antioxidant effects and that can be related to reducing the risk of heart disease. But before going any further, let me just, you know, make sure you understand alcohol is a known carcinogen in the International Agency for Research on cancer lists, it is in category one known to cause cancer in humans. So you always have to take that into account whenever you're thinking about alcohol that ethanol is a carcinogen. Now resveratrol, the other compound that I mentioned in in wine may eventually have some purpose as a supplement devoid of the alcohol. It can be made synthetically, but we have to wait on this. It is very heavily promoted by the supplement industry based on one study that was carried out. And this was a rather interesting study where they took rats and fed one group of rats just a normal rat diet, another group the normal rat diet with some resveratrol and extra fat and another group just extra fat. And I mean the diet that they gave them to 1/3 of the mice contained the resveratrol, the same stuff that you find in in wine. And it turned out that the rats that were given the high fat diet did become obese, however they did not develop any cardiac conditions, whereas the ones that were given the high fat diet but no resveratrol did develop the disease. But what remained unsaid by the supplement promoters was that the amount of resveratrol in that diet was equivalent to about 100 bottles of red wine. So it's totally unrealistic. So again, you can see that if you don't refer to numbers properly, you can lead people astray, you can lead them down the garden path. And that is very often when what supplement manufacturers will do, they will take data out of context and promote it. We of course, are dedicated to evidence. That's what we look for. And evidence sometimes comes comes in in strange ways, doesn't always come from peer reviewed trials. I'll give you a quick story here about aspirin, one of the most widely used drugs in the world. It was first synthesized by Felix Hoffman, as you can see, way back in, in in the 1800s. He also synthesized heroin. And of course that didn't turn out to have the same kind of of benefit. But aspirin, strange enough, turns out to be connected to a disease, the so-called royal disease, which is hemophilia. This is a condition where the blood doesn't clot properly and you end up bleeding. Queen Victoria was a carrier of this disease. She she had the gene. She did not have the disease. You can be a carrier and not have the disease. When 2 carriers marry, then there's a one in four chance of the child having the disease. And that's actually what happened to Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Alexandra of Russia who married the Russians are and they had a child and that was Alexi. And Alexi suffered from hemophilia. He would bleed very easily. And this is of course it's a life threatening situation. Now aspirin had just come out, and aspirin seemed to be a wonder product for all kinds of things, so her doctors recommended that she give aspirin to her son. Rasputin, The mad monk of Russia, who had weaseled himself into the Royal Court as an advisor to the Empress, said no, no, no, don't give any kind of synthetic chemical. Well, it turned out in this case that he was right. Because aspirin is an anticoagulant, it reduces the chance that blood will clot. This is the opposite of what you want in hemophilia. So it turned out that from that moment on, hemophiliacs would of course not be given any kind of aspirin preparation. So this evidence came about in a bizarre way from Rasputin, the crazy monk, right? Of course, these days we don't rely on crazy monks. We rely on on peer reviewed literature. And we know that there are no good or bad chemicals, they're just safe or dangerous ways to use them. And that chemicals should not be worshipped, they should just be understood, right? And now we understand aspirin. We know that you don't give it to hemophiliacs. However, you may want to give a small dose of aspirin to someone who has already had a heart attack because heart attacks are caused by blood clots. So in this case, you want to dissolve the blood clot. You want to, to quote, thin the blood. So the same chemical that is bad in one instance can be beneficial in another instance. So today we have the scientific information about aspirin. We know when it's appropriate for use and when it's not. It used to be that they doctors would prescribe a small dose of aspirin to seniors after the age of 65 or so. Well, now we know that that's not the case. It should only be given to people who have a history of, of, of heart attacks. So we constantly look for evidence and we will of course look for it in terms of a healthy diet. And there is evidence. I mean, you know, you can just look at this picture, right? And you, I think you would imagine that this is a healthy diet. Whereas in this case you look at that and say, Oh yeah, well, this is, you know, all of this ultra processed foods and this is unhealthy. And basically that's, that's correct, because today a lot of our, our diet is based on, on processed foods, which is, is relatively recent. I mean, it wasn't that long ago that everything had to be cooked, right? I mean, there, there was no big food industry. I mean, you, you bought raw foods and you cooked it at home. That's, that's what you ate. Believe it or not, nutritional science really didn't enter the picture until, you know, just more than 100 years ago. In fact, it was only in, in 1944 that Canada published the, the first ever recommendations, the first ever Food Guide. And if you take a look at that, you can see that that it's very similar to the recommendations that we make today, right? It's it's eat lots of fruits and vegetables, etcetera. Now that was in the 1940s and this is when food processing began to enter the picture. This is when things like the TV dinner were born where, you know, you just buy this thing in a box and you would put it into the oven. This was before microwave ovens. You have to put into the real, real oven and then you know you would eat these anemic peas and the rubbery Turkey. But it was all, it was convenient. So processing entered the picture. And indeed it is true that as you will see, many of the highly processed foods are nutritional poppers because they contain a lot of salt, they contain a lot of sugar and they contain a lot of of fat. And of course, we will discuss that today. We know a great deal about nutrition. And that's why, you know, we get back to this, the cannabis Food Guide that that I showed you before. And notice also that for beverage, where it used to be dairy, used to be milk in the glass, now it's water. So there's no emphasis on having to eat dairy because indeed it it isn't necessary. You do need protein, but you know, there's protein from other sources. Now, a lot of this nutritional evidence comes from population studies. And you look around the world and you find that population that eat more fruits and vegetables and less meat are healthier. That's what we find. I mean, I don't relish telling you this. You know, it will be more convenient to tell you that filet mignon and and French fries are the idea of food. But we go by the scientific evidence and in fact, we could encapsulate that evidence into one sentence. Eat mostly plant foods and not too much. That's really what, what basic nutrition comes comes down to. Of course, there's more to it, There's subtleties. I mean, we, you know, we look at the scientific literature and it, it backs up the population studies. I mean, we see this that, you know, adherence to various health eating patterns is beneficial, but how do we know that? How do we know these studies? Usually it stems from people filling out food frequency questionnaires and then following these people for decades to see what happens in terms of their health. This, unfortunately, is not a perfect system, and because food frequency questionnaires are very difficult to deal with, first of all, people just don't remember what they ate. If I asked you right now to take a piece of paper and write down everything that you ate yesterday, including estimating amount in terms of grams, I would venture to say that virtually none of you could do that, certainly not with any accuracy. Now, in this food frequency questionnaires, I mean, sometimes they're elaborate. They will even show you pictures in terms of amounts, but it's still very difficult. And also in these studies, it is very often assumed that people will follow the same diet that they were following when they filled out the questionnaire. How many of us eat the same thing for 25 years? It just doesn't work like that. Also, another nuance here is that people tend to fill out these questionnaires in terms of what they think they should have eaten instead of what they actually ate. And there's one classic study that showed that examined these food frequency questionnaires and detected that people were eating more broccoli than the world is capable of producing. Because of course broccoli has this aura of being a healthy food. But anyway, based on such food frequency questionnaires and peer reviewed literature, we do come to some conclusions. So there is this, for example, the healthy eating index. And you can take a look at this in in detail at at your own time because it's worthwhile. It is based on a point system where the maximum points that you can get is 100. So for example, if you eat in terms of vegetables, if you eat more than 1.1 cups per 1000 calories a day, you give yourself five points. If you eat refined grain or if you stay away from refined grains, that is, if you eat less than 1.8 oz, you give yourself 10 points. So anyway, you know, look at that carefully and and make a calculation for yourself in terms of total points. It's not difficult, difficult to to do it. It will take some, some thinking. And so the maximum that you can get for the ultimate healthy diet is is 100 points. What do we actually find? This is what we find children do pretty well because their parents are very careful about what they eat, right. And then you see as the children grow up, people pay less attention and as they get older, where they know that there are more years behind them than ahead of them, then we start looking more carefully at what we should eat to try to extend those years. And once again, as as you can see, the nutritional value goes up. It turns out that vegetarian diets make a big impact. And this, this is what the evidence is saying. And you know, we, we do go by the evidence. 7th Day Adventists are very interesting group of people to follow because they have very similar lifestyles. They live a very regimented life and many of them, not all but many are vegetarians. And in this particular study, they looked at 7th Day Adventists who were vegetarians and those who were meat eaters. And you can see that the risk of of of death over the period of the study was less in the vegetarians risk of death. It's always important to add during the period of study because sometimes, you know, you'll see headlines saying that that the risk of mortality was reduced by X percent. This is nonsense. Mortality is 100%, right? We all die. We don't like to think about it. But yeah, I mean, I don't like to think about it more than you don't like to think about it, but it happens, right? Mortality is 100%. So any time that you see mortality reduced by certain percent, it means during a certain period of a study, then you can then you can say that anyway. I mean, we have a lot of knowledge now. There are a lot of books, you know, a lot of lot of journals. But the question is how meaningful are these studies? I won't give you this one because I think this is sort of relevant to you at, at, at at your, your age. This journal Nutrients is a very impactive journal, very high quality journal. The effect of walnuts and academic stress on mental health, general well-being and the gut microbiota in a sample of university students clinical trial. So you're university students and you're stressed, Maybe not so stressed today, but you will become stressed as the midterm approaches. Are walnuts going to do you any good? OK, let's examine this this study. Well, the idea that walnuts may be healthy is not new. It goes back to the time of the Ascorades, ancient Greek philosopher who wrote one of the first books about nutrition, a very interesting book. And in this one, he suggested that walnuts were good for the brain. Why? Because the walnut looks like the human brain. And this was the beginning of what we call the doctrine of signatures, the idea that nature or God, whatever, gave humans clues about what to eat by the shape of plants or certain foods. And the reason that the walnut is shaped like the brain is because we are meant to eat it to benefit our, our, our brain. Now, obviously there's no scientific evidence for this, but today what we want to look at are the studies about walnuts, and there are some. Here's a study that actually does show some benefit of walnut consumption. Again, you can read through the abstract here in in detail. Here's another one so we can look at the scientific literature and indeed find studies. Unfortunately, this is rats and the human is not a giant rat with some exceptions, obviously. So you always have to be careful about, you know, interpreting studies that are based on, on, on, on rats. And here's another one on, on healthy aging. And it shows some benefit on, on the brain. Here's another one on, on walnuts. And, you know, this is a reflection of the study that we started with on university students. So let's look at this study. What did they actually do? Well, the amount of walnuts that they investigated was two handfuls, OK, which is about 55 to 60 grams. That's about 400 calories. Now, 400 calories is not an insignificant amount, right? Because their daily intake should be about 2000 calories. So what did they do? They enlisted the group of university students starting four weeks into the term. At that time, half of them were told that they will be given this snack of nuts, walnuts every day that they should consume. So they did. They ate the walnuts every day. The other group, the control group, was told not to eat any any kind of of nuts. Then came the first exam, at which point they were examined, asked various questions, I'll show the results in a minute. And at the end of the term, they were also asked the same kind of questions and evaluated to see whether or not consuming the walnuts made any difference. So if you look here, the Gray is the walnut consumers, the the black is the control group. So look at the stress level at the beginning of the study. That is when they were not consuming any nuts at all. That is the first visit. You can see that the stress levels as evaluated by questionnaires were roughly the same at the first midterm. The ones who were taking the walnuts actually were less stressed, and so they were at the end of the semester. And you see the same thing for anxiety and for depression. The people who were taking the walnuts were, were doing better. Similarly here, when you look at mental health and coping and overall quality of, of life, they all go in the same direction. Mood disturbance, anger. So it seemed that there was a difference. Now, of course, the differences are, are very small, right? But nevertheless, you know, it's, it's kind of interesting. And you also notice that they slept better and their quality of sleep better was, was better. What do we make of this? It's not a realistic situation. Nobody's going to eat 50 grams of, of nuts a day, right? But I mean, it's, it's still, it's an interesting study. They also looked at the microbiome. They looked at the bacteria in the gut. And this we know is important. Again, of course, we will talk extensively about that. It is important, we know that the bacteria in our digestive tract or not just bystanders, they interact with our body and we're learning more and more about that. And what they found was that there was a greater diversity of these bacteria, which is a good thing among the nut consumers. What's the benefit? I don't know. Maybe it's the alpha lianic Ansys, which is an omega-3 fatty acid. Maybe that has something to do with maybe it's chemicals called polyphenols, you know, which as you will learn, have various health benefits. It's an interesting study, but it doesn't really have any practical significance except for one. I would say that if you are deciding to have a snack, it is better to to decide on a handful of walnuts than on the doughnut. That's an easy decision. That's something that you know, we can take away from this study. But I don't think that that in order to reduce your anxiety for the first midterm, you should start now eating a handful of walnuts every day. What works better is studying that reduces your anxiety for, for the midterm. Another question that so often comes up in this world of nutrition is what if I don't have a proper balanced diet? Should I be taking supplements to sort of as, as nutritional insurance to fill in the, the, the, the blanks? Well, there have been a lot of studies on, on this. And the fact is that that in North America, in the context of the diet that we have, you don't need vitamin supplements. I mean, you would have to have a really atrocious diet to be deficient in vitamins. I mean, I suppose it's, it's possible. There's nothing wrong with taking a daily multivitamin. We'll, we'll explore that in, in somewhat greater detail. But one thing is for sure, supplements make a lot of money. It's a huge industry. It's a multibillion dollar industry, believe it or not. In North America there are 100,100 thousand different dietary supplements on the market. Now, of course you won't find all of them in the health food store, you'll find some. But you look at different health food stores, you'll find different ones. There's 100,000 available. And of course, they all try to hype the benefits. So we will take a minute and explore this one. As a final example, grapeseed extract could be the next hot supplement. OK, that's a media report. But media reports are based on scientific literature where the reporter reads a paper, usually doesn't really understand it, but tries to make something out of it. And usually it wants a catchy headline, right? Wants click bait. So here's the headline. That extract could be the next hot supplement. Of course, any time that you see something like could, you could also replace it by could not. Or if you see may, you can replace it by may not, right? Anyway, here's the study. So they looked at a compound, a specific procyanodin, which falls into the family of of of flavonoids and it had xeno therapeutic activity. Xeno therapeutic means that it treats old age, it treats senility, increases lifespan in mice. Interesting. But again, mice are not humans. What they are really talking about here is literally grapeseed. Grapes have seeds, you can grind up the seeds and you you can put them in a capsule and there you have the grape seed. So in this case the the message was that this has an anti aging effect. And of course the closer you are to aging, the more you pay attention to this kind of thing. What is the science here? The science is all about what is is called symolytic cells. Now, as you know, of course our body is composed of cells. The cells divide and throughout life the cells keep dividing and some cells die and they're replaced by new cells. For example, your red blood cells have a lifetime of both three months. You get a new set of red blood cells every every 3 three months. However, sometimes there are cells that they will divide and they become what is known as senescent. Sometimes they're called zombie cells. They are still alive, but they are no longer capable of reproducing. So these are so-called senescent cells. They're damaged cells, but nevertheless, they are still alive and they will release some chemicals that are not conducive to to aging healthily. So we are learning quite a bit about these senescence cells. They can be recognized. Look under a microscope, you can see normal cells, you can see senescence cells. And the fact is that the senescence cells secrete compounds that cause inflammation. Inflammation is nasty. It is linked with a variety of of of diseases. You want to reduce inflammation. So if these pro cyanides can do that and reduce the the the the effect of the senescent cells, that is is a good thing. So what this study looked at was one specific cyanodine that is this one. Obviously you don't need to know the chemical structures, but what they did was they took this substance that is extracted from grapeseed in the laboratory, put in Petri dishes, they put in some cells and they studied the effect on the cells. That's a long way from us. We are not a large Petri dish, we're not large rats, we're not large mice. However, these studies can trigger further studies. This is where you start to see if there's any effect and there was an effect. I mean, you, you can read this at, at your leisure. This is the conclusion of the of the study. They actually did find some benefit of this grape seed extract on cells in the laboratory and on, on mice. And they came to the conclusion that this chemical has some potential, at least in mice and, and you know, in, in the laboratory. It's an interesting study. It will not come to anything. I, I can pretty well tell you that because I've seen this for 50 years of studies that, you know, show some kind of fantastic effect, you know, in animals or in the laboratory, but never translate to, to humans. But some will show some benefit and you don't know. So, you know, everything starts like this. It starts in in the lab. But you have to be careful not to come to any conclusion other than that. If you raise mice at home, you might consider giving them some grapeseed extract. You know, it might make them live longer if that's what you what you want. So the story here really is that nutrition is fascinating, but it is really like walking through a maze because we have so much information, it's hard to know exactly what to what to make of it all. But of course we will. We'll try, we'll take a look at all the studies. We'll, you know, see which ones are worthwhile, which which are not. Information is what it's all about. So let me just remind you once more to go to our website, mcgill.ca/OSS, sign up for the newsletter. It will be very helpful for you and you just click on the button there. We also have a YouTube channel and you can go there as well. It's youtube.com, McGill OSS. I think it should be more informative and more entertaining than your Instagram or TikTok. So take a look and next time we will start really the meat of the course, although we will limit the amount of of meat intake and take a look at the so-called macro nutrients, the proteins, fats and carbohydrates that make up the bulk of our food. All right, next time. Also, let me tell you that the recorded lecture usually appears one to two days after the lecture, so it's not immediate. All right, see you next time. Hi. I've looked at the schedule for the past two years on this course. Is the final exam also online? Yes. Yeah, the time is fixed. That's fixed by the university. You'll join the group. Thank you. Where does it come from? No, I don't have this one. Where does it come from? Does it mean anything like whenever you order some particular? I. See. OK. Thanks very much. Hi. I get that. I'm soon going to get that, yeah. And I'm still watches your stuff on Facebook. And she was three years she's been saying go to Mcgilly and hope Professor Schwartz is still there. So I'm still here. I'm really excited to thank you. Thanks. I mean, it, you know, there's a lot of money to be made by, you know, all those supplements and but we, we look for the science, OK? Yeah. I don't know. It's done with a magic chemical. It's invisible. It's invisible. Oh, very good. Didn't you get A and everything so far in every course? What's that? Yeah, Yeah. How do you How do you interpret rough? But she had good slides, no full page. You know, I, I used to do that. And then that was when people were printing them out and they said there's too much paper to do it. That's what's special. But I guess you just look at them online. That is helpful if I like open it up on APDF and then I edit it so I can take those directly onto the slides so I don't have to like write everything down that is already on the slides. But. I guess I can do that. It's probably actually easier to do that. Yeah, yeah. I just just wondering like maybe because I thought maybe you just did that because there's so many and like you didn't want to make this. Well, well, this is also true, but of course, online it doesn't even matter. Yeah. Yeah, no, but yeah, see, yeah. I remember when we I start switch to that because people would print, print them out, Yeah. And then so much paper. Yeah, I didn't. Think it do that but I can. Do that. OK, Yeah, I can. Do that. Thank you. For three hours.
