Biotin supplements are often marketed to consumers for their potential to improve hair
regrowth, brittle nails, and skin rashes because of their role in cell growth and metabolism.
While biotin supplementation may improve pathologic hair and nail syndromes in patients who
have laboratory-proven deficiencies in vitamin B7, there are limited data on the efficacy of
biotin supplementation in treating common hair loss and nail disorders, with merely one
clinical trial to date.1 Although there was an observed increase in hair density and subjective
differences in hair shedding, strength, breakage, and brightness after biotin supplementation,
this study is limited by its single-institution setting and small sample size that relied on subject
perception through self-assessment questionnaires.1 Despite biotin’s rise in social media
popularity, few studies support its efficacy.2
Patients who are undergoing treatment for cancer may experience hair and nail changes
secondary to chemotherapeutic and endocrine agents. Hair loss has been identified as one of the
most emotionally distressing side effects of chemotherapy for many patients. Among breast
cancer survivors, hair loss/thinning was reported as the most severe symptom experienced
during the first year after diagnosis.3 Furthermore, in another survey of patients with breast
cancer, 53% noted hair loss as the most emotionally distressing part of chemotherapy.4 As
patients navigate these changes, marketing for biotin supplements promise potential for hair
and nail regrowth. Biotin is also an ingredient in popular oral products such as Nutrafol and
Viviscal. In a study conducted on patients in cancer support Facebook groups, patients were
most likely to have tried an oral supplement for hair regrowth—surpassing all topical treatment
options.5 Compared with topical products, biotin supplements are easier to administer and may
be more economical.1 Furthermore, merely 6% reported speaking to their oncologist or der-
matologist about hair and nail growth concerns.5
Importantly, biotin has been shown to interfere with several laboratory tests, including those
used for monitoring cancer progression and treatment outcomes. This occurs because biotin
affects streptavidin-biotin binding used in many immunoassays. When present in excess, biotin
competes with biotinylated antibodies or antigens for binding to streptavidin-coated magnetic
surfaces, resulting in reduced capture of the biotinylated antibodies or antigens.6 This ulti-
mately leads to falsely elevated results in competitive immunoassays and falsely low results in
noncompetitive, or sandwich, immunoassays.6,7 These inaccurate laboratory results may delay
or alter patients’ treatment plans.
Studies have shown that biotin has the potential to affect laboratory tests used for thyroid,
breast, endometrial, ovarian, germ cell, paraneoplastic, and prostate cancers. Researchers
found that a single dose of biotin ingestion (eg, 10-300 mg once daily) in healthy volunteers can
interfere with selected laboratory tests including free thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine
(T3), thyroglobulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, testosterone, ferritin, pro-
gesterone, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), parathyroid hormone, luteinizing hormone, and
follicle-stimulating hormone.6,8 By binding to streptavidin-coated detection systems, biotin
can lead to falsely low results in sandwich assays (eg, TSH and PSA) and falsely high results in
competitive assays (eg, estradiol and testosterone).6 These inaccurate results are clinically
significant for many reasons: falsely low TSH levels can lead to misdiagnosis of hyperthy-
roidism or misinterpretation during immunotherapy; falsely elevated estradiol may delay the
initiation of endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer; and artificially
low PSA may mask recurrence in prostate cancer survivors.

Alternatively, oncologists could consider topical minoxidil
as a safe and effective treatment option for patients with
cancer experiencing hair loss.9 With no known contrain-
dications in oncology patients and minimal side effects,
minoxidil is generally well tolerated and affordable,
with over-the-counter formulations averaging $21.87 US
dollars (USD) per 60 mL for women and $20.62 USD per
60 mL for men.10,11 In one randomized controlled trial,
87.5% of patients using 5% topical minoxidil experienced
significant improvement of hair regrowth after chemo-
therapy compared with 55% in the placebo group.12
When counseling patients with cancer who are interested in
hair and nail regrowth, oncologists should be familiar with
biotin’s interference with immunoassay-based laboratory
tests.4 Patients taking high-dose biotin supplementation
(>100 mg/day once daily) should undergo a minimum of a
2- to 3-day washout period before blood collection to
minimize error in laboratory results.5,7 In addition, oncol-
ogists should consider the lack of scientific evidence for
biotin supplementation in promoting hair and nail regrowth.
Finally, the American Academy of Dermatology has released
a cautionary statement sharing their agreement that biotin
supplementation should not be used as a primary treatment
option for hair or nail regrowth.13 Importantly, there is no
evidence from peer-reviewed studies suggesting that biotin
increases the risk of cancer recurrence or progression. The
main concern regarding its use in this population is the lack
of proven efficacy, interference with certain laboratory tests,
and the availability of better-supported alternatives such as
topical minoxidil. Our call to action is for oncologists to ask
patients about how they are treating any dermatologic side
effects and to offer caution to patients considering starting
oral supplements.
