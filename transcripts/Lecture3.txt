We have another connection still together. His son. 19 has taken this part and my daughter was 22. Yes. And my son made the mistake of saying, Dad, you want to come? Yeah. OK, well hope you enjoyed it. Yeah. Am I wrong in assuming that everyone in this class can read? None. None. None. OK, yeah, let's get it going. Before we go any further, I have a recommendation for you guys, something to watch if you have access to Amazon Prime. There's a story of Céline Dion, a documentary which is absolutely fascinating to to watch because as as you probably know, she suffers from this very rare disease, strikes one in a million people. It's called stiff, stiff person syndrome. It's a horrific condition where they slowly lose the ability to, to move. And it's really, it's a heartbreaking story when you watch it, when you see, you know, someone who basically arose from nothing. You know, she comes from an extremely poor family, 13 brothers and sisters she has and she became a a mega star with, you know, everything you'd ever want. And then she got struck with this horrific disease. It's really a captivating story. OK, so last time we talked about proteins and we basically established what they are. And then we talked about fats. Now we're going to move on to the next class of the macro nutrients and those are the carbohydrates. Well, first, to clear up a little bit of confusion in in the terminology here and where it comes from, it dates back to a time before molecular structures were understood. But they were able to analyze substances in terms of their elemental composition. And so they were able to analyze glucose as you can see, AC6H12O6, etcetera. But they didn't know how these atoms were joined together. They didn't know anything about molecular bonding. And it just seemed that those empirical formulas all conformed to the possibility of, of, you know, all conform to the possibility of, of, you know, carbons being linked to water molecules. It is not correct, of course, because today we know that the molecular structure of glucose is is like this, but that's only because we understand molecular bonding now. But so the term carbohydrate is just an antiquated term, but of course we still use it to describe this class of molecules which are made of sugars joined together in some way. Glucose is what's referred to as a monosaccharide. Monosaccharide, the simplest kind of sugar. And if it is joined together to a molecule of fructose, chemically speaking, then you have sucrose. That's what we refer to as table sugar. And if instead you have a molecule of galactose and glucose, then you have lactose. That's the sugar that we find in milk to to which some people are are intolerant. If you have three of these carbohydrates joined together, such as in this compound raffinose, that would be referred to as an oligosaccharide, oligo, meaning a few. And if you have a long chain of these joined together, as you have in starch with many glucose molecules joined together, that is called a polysaccharide. Now the term saccharide comes from the Latin meaning sweet, because the simple sugars like glucose and sucrose actually do taste sweet, of course. So here's a classification of of carbohydrates. So they can be the simple sugars or what referred to as the complex sugars. If there are only one or two units, sugar units joined together, then the simple sugars. If there's more than their complex sugars. And in a much more simplified fashion, the carbohydrates divided into simple and complex. And the complex also includes fiber, in which many, many sugar units are joined together, often in a complex fashion. All right. Well, with that being said, why is it important that we consume carbohydrates? As we already mentioned, the human body is like a machine. It's a very complicated machine. It's probably the most complex machine on the face of the earth. But like any machine, it needs to be fueled all right. The analogy, of course, would be to a car. It can't run without gasoline, and the human body can't run without the source of of energy. And the source of that energy is the simple molecule that referred to as as glucose. Now other carbohydrates also furnish energy because in the body they are broken down to simple sugars like glucose. So if you look at sugar, ordinary table sugar or sucrose, which we established was two small units joined together, when you eat this, it is metabolized. Digestive juices break it down into individual glucose and fructose, which then can serve as a source of energy. The same thing can happen with starch. Starch is just a long chain of glucose units. But when you eat starch, it's broken down and you can use the glucose for energy. But what if you consume more of these carbohydrates that is needed to supply the immediate energy needs? Then these can be stored in the body, in the muscles or in the liver in the form of glycogen. So glycogen is just a complex molecule made-up of individual glucose units and it is a source of glucose whenever it isn't coming in in the diet. So if you are expending energy and you've used up your stores of glucose, which happens very quickly, then the liver and your muscles will start to release glucose into the into the bloodstream. You've probably heard the term carbohydrate loading that is done by athletes before a particularly strenuous event like like a marathon. Carbohydrate loading is really what the term describes. It is consuming a lot of carbohydrate prior to the event so that you fulfill your body's storage capacity for glucose that is in in form of glycogen. So that whenever you run out of glucose, the body will start to break down the glycogen and release glucose into into the bloodstream. So the classic example here would be a marathon runner. When you are running the marathon, you need a quick source of energy, so you're body will use the glucose that is already pleasant in in your bloodstream. When that runs out, glycogen starts to be broken down and you use the glucose that comes from from there. But that is not a big storage place, so that indeed you only have a certain amount of glycogen reserve. It will very quickly run out and that's why you have to keep refurbishing it. And that's why you will see the marathon runners during the event consume various types of carbohydrates, usually in the form of gels, because those are very quickly absorbed. However, there's a problem there too with the quick absorption, because if you are consuming only very simple carbohydrates like glucose and fructose, that will very quickly build up in the stomach and the body then senses an overload of glucose in the stomach and it reacts to that and it will give you the urge to to vomit. So this is not the best way to do this. That's why these gels are very specially designed to contain both glucose and to also contain molecules that will go through the stomach and go to the intestine from where they will release glucose into the bloodstream. So you don't get a sudden buildup of glucose in the stomach, which the body doesn't doesn't like. So in order to to do that, you need a molecule that is capable of releasing glucose but will not do it in the stomach, which will quickly traverse the stomach and go into the into the intestine. And that would be something like maltodextrin. Maltodextrin is a polymer. It is made-up of small units of of glucose and this is what you will see marathon runners and and long distance bicycle racers consumed during the race and multodextrin and cyclodextrin. These are very similar to starch. They are many glucose units joined together that traverse the stomach and end up in the intestine, and there they release glucose. I mean, if you want to have sort of a mental picture of what cyclodextrin looks like, each little circle here represents A glucose molecule. It's a very complex system, but it is relatively easily produced. You make it from cornstarch by enzymatic treatment and this is what many marathoners will sip during the race. For example. I'm I'm just using Kipchoka here as as the example because he is maybe the most incredible marathon runner who is the only person in history who has run a sub two-minute 2/2 hour marathon. Anyone here a marathoner? Half half marathoner. What was your time for 1/2 marathon? Well then you have you have some idea of what a 2 hour marathon is and, and really only if you've done any running can you appreciate what that is. If you've ever been on a treadmill, right, The treadmill goes up usually to 12 mph. That's the fastest a treadmill goes. That's not fast enough for a marathon. They run at 13 mph for two hours. This is it's just an incredible performance. If you have access to a treadmill, try it. See if you can go up to 12. I would wager that you couldn't keep your feet going fast enough for five seconds at 12 and they run a 13 for two hours. Now when he did his sub two hour marathon, that needs an* actually, because that wasn't in an official marathon. It was on a course that was actually flat to give the best possible time and he ran with Pacers who ran in front of him basically to break the wind and a pace car with a laser beam telling him exactly at what speed that he was running. But nevertheless, he did it in just under 2 hours. The record for the real marathon under competitive situations is 2 hours and 35 seconds, which is also of course fantastic. But I tell you that that that 35 seconds, that is a a big, big gap between two hours, 35 seconds and and just two hours. Someone eventually will run a marathon in under 2 hours under proper race conditions. So anyway, now you understand why they take gels regularly because they have to to boost their stores of of glucose. Now the most famous carbohydrate, of course, is is sucrose. This is table sugar. This is the stuff that makes the medicine go down so easily because it tastes so good. The literature, the scientific literature on sucrose is voluminous. Virtually every day we have some new scientific paper come out about consuming sugar, and the results are always negative. It's always that you should not consume too much sugar. There are limits on what the the body can handle. And here is one such example. And you can see that, you know, they advise you about not eating too much sugar. And here it is encapsulated and you can see that you really want you to limit your, your intake. And there are numerous studies like this. A it's as I said, really it's virtually every day. In this particular case, negative effect of excessive added sugar. And one of the most interesting studies that has come out recently, and this is well worth talking about. I'm paying attention to. Because it basically describes the consequences of high sugar intake when you're very young and that this will have consequences when you become an adult. The story is absolutely a fascinating 1. During the Second World War, sugar was rationed in England so you were only able to get a very small amount, which meant of course that sugar consumption was way down. By the 1950s after the war, sugar was again on on sale and as you can imagine it was a much sought after commodity. Children lined up in front of the candy stores to get the sugar that they had been robbed of during the war. Well, now those children have grown up and they're adults and their health status can be examined, which is exactly what was done in England with the so-called Bio Bank study. Here's a fascinating study. We've gotten a lot of information out of this and it basically involves thousands of people who have volunteered to fill out dietary questionnaires to answer questions about their health status, etcetera, to see if there's any relationship between diet and and health. And out of this particular Bio Bank study came the really quite remarkable result about how exposure to sugar, specifically sucrose during early life has its tentacles reaching into the future. Because when these kids grew up, the amount of sugar that they consumed could be related to their health status. That's pretty amazing study and it shows you that it is worthwhile paying attention to sugar consumption when you're very young. Of course, that usually doesn't happen. You start paying attention to your health only later on in life when you start encountering problems. Now, of course, the question that comes up is how can we physiologically explain this? What, What on earth is sugar doing in the body? It's a very complex process, but the problem is that sugar will react with amino acids, which of course found in proteins in the body, in a complex chemical reaction to form what we call advanced glycation end products. Now I know that that is a mouthful of an expression and some of you who have taken organic chemistry will be able to relate to this. Because what it means is that sugars can react with amino acids to form brand new compounds and these can wreak havoc in different parts of of the body, even in your skin. Because it turns out that these glysation end products will in fact interact with with collagen in your skin and disturb the function of of of the skin. This is often demonstrated by pictures like that, which may be a bit excessive. I mean, I don't think that if you just cut out sugar early in your life, you're going to have smooth skin for the rest of your life. But there certainly is a connection. And there's a connection, not only your skin, but a connection to many other organs in your body where the so-called AG ES build up and wreak havoc. Now to to complicate this even further, these byproducts form in the body between sugars and amino acids, but they can also form outside of the body because food contains sugars and amino acids. And these exogenous products are formed in what is called the Myard reaction. This is a very common reaction in in chemistry, especially in in cooking, where proteins will react with sugars under a high temperature. And they form compounds like in the baking of bread, the brown stuff, the crust of the bread is basically formed by these compounds. And the same thing happens when you roast coffee because it contains amino acids and it contains sugars. And the same thing happens when you fry a steak because steak also contains proteins and small amounts of, of sugar. And if you put some some sort of sauce on on it before you put it on the BBQ, then you even increase the chance of this Myod reaction, which is a double edged sword because this is what gives you the flavor. But these are also the compounds that interfere with many organs, as I as I mentioned. And if you think that that is kind of depressing, I can impress you even further because there's a study that showed that the intake, excessive intake of, of of sugar is linked to depression. Now this word linked to this is always problematic because link or association does not mean cause and effect, right? And that's a very important point to understand. As you know, we you know already mentioned that that the decline in store population in Germany parallels a decline in birth rate does not allow you to conclude that stork spring babies. So these association studies always have to be taken with a grain of salt. But in this case, this National Health and Nutrition Survey in the US is a is a fascinating one because what they did was again, with a large number of volunteers, thousands of volunteers. They communicated with them through the phone several times during a long period. And they were asked to, to fill out dietary surveys about what, what they eat. And also they were asked about their mental status. And you know, they're these, these are standard forms that people fill out from which psychologists and psychiatrists can analyze the degree of, of depression, mental status, etcetera. And so, So what they found was a link that people who consumed more sugar were more likely to be interpreted from these questionnaires as suffering from depression. So there's always, you know, when, whenever you look look at such questionnaires, I mean, there's, you know, it's always a problem of people, you know, whether they fill it out accurately or not. But you just hope that when you have a large enough number of subjects in these studies, then the errors will kind of equal out. But there's always a lot of of of issues with such studies. But anyway, they did find that a higher incidence of depression in people consuming more than about 90 grams of of sugar. But as I said, a study like that, even though it's a monumental effort and it involves thousands of people, it has pitfalls. For example, the big problem that we have to deal with in such studies is what we refer to as reverse causation. Is it not possible that people who are depressed are more likely to eat sweet stuff to put them in a better mood? That's a very real possibility, right? So this would be what we refer to as as reverse causation. Then do you have the problem of filling out these questionnaires? The questionnaires are generally, you know of of this type asking you how many times you've consumed a certain food over the last little while. This is very difficult to remember, especially when people are asked about the amount of food that they that they consumed. Very difficult to to judge. But anyway, based on such studies, which of course there have been many, we can arrive at a rough guess of what is, you know, an excessive amount of sugar that we should not be consuming. And this is this is sort of what we've arrived at. Now, roughly 90 grams of sugar should be the total amount of sugar that we take in a day. And of this, 30 grams is what we call added sugar, which is actually added to the food as simple sugar instead of being part of the food. As you know, an apple will contain natural sugar that would not count as added sugar, but it will be part of the 90 grams. Children should consume much less based on the study that I just told you about in in the the Biobank study. So added sugars are, for example, what we would find in soft drinks. Obviously the sugar is added to that, but apple juice also has sugar. It can have the same amount of sugar naturally occurring as you'd find in a soft drink. That would not be part of the 30 grams, but it would be part of the 90 grams that you're supposed to take in every day. Now, it is true that if you look at an apple and you look at a doughnut, they can have about the same amount of sugar. Of course, it depends on the size of the apple, the size of the doughnut, but you're in the same ballpark. But I think it is obvious that you should be eating the apple and not the doughnut. The sugar content is the same, so the calorie content can be the same. But with the apple, of course you're getting minerals and vitamins and and polyphenols and all kinds of things that you're not getting in the in in the doughnut. But when you're concerned about calories, then of course every calorie counts. So that's why you need to be aware of where you find sugar. Have a slice of apple pie, that's about 25 grams. Have a small Hershey chocolate bar, that's another 25 grams. And if you want to have a visual of what you put into your coffee, if you put two spoons of sugar into your coffee, that's about 8g. So you can see it is very easy to get up to 3040 grams of added sugar a day. Most people, of course, exceed that. And a lot of that is because of soft drinks. This is the biggest source of added sugar in the North American diet. And the problem here is that people don't realize it because you don't see it. The sugar is dissolved in the liquid. But if I show you how much sugar there is, I think it makes for a pretty impacted mental picture. Pour yourself a little glass of Coke. That's the amount of sugar that you have in there because sugar is extremely soluble. So sucrose dissolves very easily in in in water. If you want another visual, that amount of of sugar is about 17 cubes of sugar. You would never put 17 cubes of sugar into your coffee, would you? But you have no problem drinking a glass of soft drink. So I think one could say, and I do say that if there were one thing we could do in the North American diet that would have the biggest impact on health, it would be to cut out sugar sweetened soft drinks. It's never going to happen because the industry, of course, is gigantic, the soft drink industry. I mean, you turn on your TV and virtually every second ad is for, you know, some highly sweetened beverage or, or, or food. But if we did that, if we eliminate it or, or cut down, we'd also cut down on depression, as we just mentioned, right? Because we saw the study that links sugar to to depression. So it's important to know where you find sugar. Let's find it. Fruit Loops. I think you would have a pretty good idea that this is not a health food, right? But what about numbers? How much sugar do you have in there in, in, in a serving? And as you can see on the label, about 14 grams. You should also appreciate one thing is that the serving sizes that they talk about in all of these foods is generally much smaller than what you would naturally eat. OK. They the serving size that they talk about of, of of of cereal. There is One Cup, 1 cup of cereal is a very small amount. People usually use a bowl and fill that with with cereal. So there there's a lot of sugar there. Do you get lucky with Lucky Charms? I think your guess would be no, and you'd be right. It has a roughly the same amount of of sugar, which of course is what kids like. That's why the sugar is in there. How about Honey Nut Cheerios? That actually has a bit of a better nutritional profile, but when you look at the sugar content, it's still pretty high. Now what is interesting here is when you compare the Honey Nut Cheerios to regular Cheerios, the regular Cheerios actually have very little sugar. So if you're looking for a cereal which has the least sugar, Cheerios, which still tastes pretty decent. Although I think that if you really want to make the healthiest choice, you'd go for Fiber one. Fiber 1 is very low in sugar content. But more important than that, if you take a look at the amount of fiber in there, that's that meets your daily requirements for fiber. And we talked last time about all the benefits of eating foods that are high in fiber. So I think that's a pretty good cereal. But I'll also point out something to you is that fiber one in all of the classifications would be classified as an ultra processed food. And you hear a lot these days about ultra processed foods and their wickedness, right In terms of of health. Well, not all ultra processed foods are the same nutritionally. OK, the chips does not have the same nutritional profile as fiber One and yet they would both be ultra processed because it's an A lot of processing that is involved. Something else that is important to point out is that there are many sweeteners other than just granulated sugar that people use. So for example, Maple syrup. Maple syrup industry presents itself as somehow a healthy alternative to cane sugar. It does contain some polyphenols, but the amount is insignificant in the context of your overall diet. Maple syrup is essentially A concentrated solution of sugar, and because sugar is so soluble in water, it turns out that a tablespoonful of Maple syrup actually has more sugar in it than a tablespoonful of granulated sucrose, because you can dissolve more in in water. The only reason to put Maple syrup on your pancake is because you like the taste and it is a better taste. I mean, there's no question Maple syrup will taste better than corn syrup. We'll get to corn syrup in a in a minute. But health wise, it really doesn't matter. In fact, you're getting more calories as I suggested. And what about Honeywell? Honey is still sugar. It does not have exactly the same carbohydrate composition as as table sugar because it contains, as you can see, a lot of fructose. But whether it's fructose or glucose, the calorie content is the same. But once again, there are compounds present in honey that are not there in purified crystalline sugar because, you know, the bees gather pollen and pollen has some polyphenols in it, etcetera. And manufacturers of honey will play this up and suggest that, you know it is somehow healthier than than than sugar. Great for health and well-being. What on earth does that mean? It's a meaningless statement. So no, there's nothing magical about honey. Eat honey because you like the taste of honey. That's the only reason. And you know, I'm not being facetious about that. I mean, you know, you shouldn't decide on every bit of food as whether it meets, you know, nutritional requirements or not. Food is also source of a lot of pleasure in life and you know, that should not be forgotten. And then there is this, the high fructose corn syrup, which is today probably the most common sweetener that you see in soft drinks and then many other foods too. And if you go on social media, you will be absolutely frightened by, you know, stuff like this telling you that high fructose corn syrup is is really the devil Incarnate. Kennedy is one of the believers of that. The devil doesn't believe in this devil. Anyway, what is it? What is it? Here's the simple process by which you make high fructose corn syrup. You take corn, you mill it into a powder. You add an enzyme, alpha amylase, which then breaks down the starch molecules into shorter carbohydrates, the only gold saccharines. You add another enzyme that breaks it down to glucose. So what corn syrup really is, is. Solution of glucose in water. That's what corn syrup is. So of course it's not going to taste exactly the same as Maple syrup or as honey. But then they add another enzyme which is xylose isopenarase, which converts some of the glucose to fructose. Fructose is actually sweeter than sugar than than glucose. So you increase the the the sweetness, but that's not the real reason. What do you think is the real reason? What is usually the real reason behind any such manipulation? It's cheaper, you can make high fructose corn syrup very cheap, and you can make it taste sweet because the fructose is sweeter than glucose. There are usually 2 forms that are produced industrially. 1 contains 42% fructose and the other 155, and the 55 is what you find in in mostly in soft drinks. And of course this is also what is used in in in many highly processed foods like in ketchup. You look on the label of the ketchup and you see that it contains high fructose corn syrup. And if you look on the label of soft drinks, there you go, high fructose corn syrup. Now the question comes up. High fructose corn syrup breaks down into glucose and fructose. Sucrose, as we saw table sugar is also glucose and fructose. So what's the difference? Once you ingest them, they both break down to the same thing. Yes, but not in the same proportion because high fructose corn syrup will have more fructose once it dissolves than what sucrose provides. Calorie wise it makes no difference. However, fructose is not handled by the body metabolically the same way and we know this because there have been numerous studies and of course nutrition. There'd been numerous studies on, on, on, on everything. And you can see here when they, you know, analyze intake of glucose and fructose, you can make a case for fructose being more problematic. It can lead in high doses. It can lead to what is known as fatty liver disease because the fructose will build up in the liver and fatty liver disease is not something you want to deal with. Usually it is because of alcoholism, but it's can also be due to excessive intake of of fructose. I don't want to make too big a deal of this, but the fact is that, you know, there are studies out there that do show that fructose is more metabolically problematic than is is glucose. And not only in terms of of enhancing the chance of fatty liver disease, but also it seems that fructose is used by cancer cells as a nutrient more favorably than glucose. However, as you know, with every study, there's a but. And what is the but here? It's one that we usually see in these nutritional studies is this is done in the lab with animals. And just because you see faster rate of a tumor that is implanted into an animal, which is then given high dose of fructose doesn't mean that this can be extrapolated to to people. It doesn't mean that if you have pet mice, it's probably a good idea to keep them away from consuming a lot of fructose. But I would not make too much of, of, of the fructose business. I think any soft drink should be curbed, whether it's made with high fructose corn syrup, whether it's made with sucrose, because in the body it will lead to, to, to problems. So obviously we have learned so far that it's important to watch your diet. It is very complicated to be sure you know, in terms of what, what you have to watch. But but we see that that paying attention to what you put into your mouth eventually pays off. All right, let's pass on to now the micronutrients. So we have talked about proteins and fats and carbohydrates. These are the so-called macro nutrients because these make up the bulk of our diet. However, we could not live on a diet that is purely fat, carbohydrate and protein because the body also requires micronutrients, which are needed in very small amounts. And the first group that we're going to look at are the vitamins, which are probably the most famous of the micronutrients. And the definition here is very simple. Vitamins are needed by the body in very small amount to prevent deficiency diseases and the body cannot make them. We have to take them in in the diet. Now, the general statement these days is that a balanced diet will contain all of the vitamins that that we need. And I think that that is in general is a true statement. But of course it begs the question of what is a balanced diet. I think in terms of vitamins in North America it would be very unlikely to have a such an unbalanced diet that you'd be deficient in vitamins because vitamins are needed in very small amounts in rare cases possible as as as you will see, there are 13 vitamins that have been identified and they divide into two categories. They're either fat soluble or water soluble. The fat soluble ones are the ones we have to pay more attention to in terms of potential toxicity because they are retained in the body. They dissolve in body fat. The water soluble ones in excessive amounts will go out in the urine. So if you take in an excess of the water soluble vitamins, basically what you do is make your P more valuable. All right, let's get into the vitamin story from from the beginning. And that beginning is in the late 1700s, early 1800s, with Francois Majandi, a French scientist who wanted to take a look at what had to be eaten in order to maintain health. And he experimented with animals as as one would do. And he discovered that when he would feed only fat or only protein or only sugar to an animal, it pretty soon got sick. And he concluded that a single food will not be able to sustain life, that nutrition is more more complicated. So this was really the the beginning. There was another very interesting scientific point that was made at that time by the so-called Gelatin Commission, which was set up in in France. And the idea here was how to supply food to the poor because there was a shortage of of food. And what the Gelatin Commission wanted to know was whether or not if you extracted whatever you could extract from bones, whether or not that could serve as a source of nutrition because basically bones didn't have any other value. Well, it turned out that they discovered that indeed, when you cook up bones, you do extract something. Well, today we know what it is. You extract gelatin, which is is a protein. But a single protein is not enough to sustain life. So they discovered that. No, it it wasn't. It wasn't possible to do that. Well, we this idea of boiling your bones is still with us. A bone broth, as you may know, has become, especially on social media, sort of a magical concoction that you're supposed to drink to boost your protein intake and make you healthier, etcetera. It has become very popular. If you ever go to New York, it's worthwhile to drop by this place, Brodo. It's a little window, but people line up on the sidewalk to buy their bone broth because of the mystique that they have built about it, that this has some sort of, you know, magical nutritional benefits, which it doesn't. It actually is very low in vitamins. It does have some some protein, but there's nothing magical about bone broth. So the Gelatin Commission did not find anything that that, you know, could feed the poor in Germany. Eustace von Liebig, who was the the best known German chemist at that time, also tried to tackle this problem. And he came up with his own version, which was another meat meat extract. But it wasn't only bones, it was actually meat there too. So he came up with this supplement, as you can see, extract of meat, which could be made quite cheaply from meat by products and and and bones. And it was a better source of, of nutrition and it was indeed used by poor people who couldn't afford to buy anything better. And that concept is still with us today. Bavaril, for example, which you can find in supermarket or Oxo cubes. These are all meat extracts that dates all the way back to to Liebeck. But the real story of vitamins begins with the first observation of a vitamin deficiency disease, and this was Berry Berry. And in English that translates from the old Sri Lankan word I cannot, I cannot. And these were people who basically could not move. It was a terrible condition. They kind of withered away. Well, it turned out that this had a nutritional component, although it took quite some while to to figure this out. But it was at first a Japanese researcher who compared the diet on two types of of, of Japanese ships where one type of sailor was given rice that was we call polished rice, where the bran is removed and some others on other ships, the diet was the whole grain rice with with the bran on it. And discovered that there was a difference in the incidence of this horrific disease. Very, very, which was very common in Asia in those days because the diet basically was rice and it was the white rice that was the issue. But I mean, he, he really didn't understand what was going on in terms of, of chemistry. Our scientific understanding began with Doctor Christian Eichmann, who was a Dutch researcher, but he worked in Java in the, in the Orient, which at that time was a, a Dutch colony. And he decided that he was going to take a look at, you know, this terrible disease. Very, very. Now this was at a time where Pasteur had already introduced the germ theory of disease. So people knew about bacterial diseases and he wondered, is this a bacterial disease? Which was of course a very legitimate question to ask. It could be. So how do you investigate this? Well, of course you don't do it on people, you try it on animals. So injected chickens with blood from people who had been struck down with beri beri and discovered that no, nothing happened. So it was not a transmissible disease. He worked in a hospital in Java, which was a military hospital, which it turned out was a luck stroke of luck because there were chickens raised in the courtyard of that hospital to feed the the patients. And those chickens were fed polished rice. And it turned out that the the cook refused to allow military rice to be given to civilian chickens. So they got the the white rice while the the patients got the the nutritious rice. And it turned out that the chickens came down with Berry Berry. And Eichmann noticed this and he then concluded wrongly, that there must be some toxin that is in white rice that is somehow neutralized by something in the bran. Now that was wrong, but not illogical at all. You remember that, you know, science knowledge was a primitive in in in those days. So this was, you know, logical conclusion to to come to Anyway, he then told this story to Adolf Vorderman, another physician, and they decided to investigate this in in people. And the prisoners were no, I mean, they didn't have much choice. I think they were used as as human Guinea pigs and some were served brown rice and some were served white rice. And only the ones who served who got the white rice developed Berry Berry. But they still didn't understand the chemistry. They didn't know what was going on here. It was much later, 19 O six, that Frederick Gallant Hopkins was able to isolate A substance from the rice bran that could prevent Berry Berry. He didn't know what it was. He wasn't able to categorize it chemically, but he was able to isolate the crystalline material from the brand that could prevent Berry Berry. And eventually he got the Nobel Prize that he actually shared with Eichmann for having solved the problem of of beri beri. In hindsight, of course, simple solution you just give. You don't give people polished rice as the sole source of of of nutrition. Finally, it was Kasimir Funk who managed to isolate the active ingredient and by this time chemistry had advanced. It was able to analyze what this was chemically and it fell into the category of substances known as amines. Amines are are a type of molecule where have a nitrogen attached to a carbon. And he at first thought that the substances that you can find in food that can prevent disease are all amines and they were vital to life, which of course is how we got the term vitamin. Although interestingly enough, he realized that there might be other substances that could be discovered in food that would protect against disease but which were not a means but he already coined the word vitamin. So in order to kind of not have people think that they're all A means, they drop the ending E from vitamin. But that's the history of the disease today. We know what that factor is in in brown rice. This is what we call vitamin B1 or thiamine and it's available as you can see, and in supplement form in North America, of course, we do not see Berry Berry, but still some people take B vitamins as supplement thinking that it gives them extra energy. And we'll talk about that in a in a few minutes. So the Berry Berry problem was solved. It was the first time that the concept of vitamins was introduced in the United States. There was another disease, as much a problem as Berry Berry in the in the East, and that was a disease known as pellagra, which struck mostly in the Southern US, which of course, was very poor. This was still, you know, when slavery had not been completely eliminated. Anyway, Doctor Joseph Goldberger was a physician who was asked by the US Public Health Service to look into this problem of what was going on, what was this disease, pellagra. And so he did, and this was in the early 1900s and, and he began to look into this disease. As you can see, it was very common among cotton pickers. And, and at first they thought that maybe it has something to do with cotton seed oil. Anyway, they, they really didn't know. What they did know was that this was a horrific disease. It is a disease that is characterized by the four DS dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, concluding finally in in death. Now what was characteristic of the diet in the South was that it was almost all corn based. I'm not getting enough power here. What do you think is the chance of having that socket fixed by next class I I would put that probability at 0. All right, So the, the southern diet was essentially based on, on, on corn, just like in the east, it was based on, on rice. And so Goldberger decided to look into this and, and launch an experiment. And once again, prisoners were the volunteers. And in those days that was quite a common thing that prisoners would be used for scientific experiments. And if they, quote volunteered, they would be given some compensation, let out early or something, whatever. So anyway, Goldberger began an experiment with with diet and he tried to, as you can see, strictly control the diet. Some got only corn based, some got vegetables, some got meat, etcetera. And eventually, you know, he was able to figure out that the people who had a diet that was essentially based on, on corn were the ones who were more likely to come down with with pellagra. And he didn't know exactly, you know, what was going on yet, except that it, again, somehow it was related to to food. He also at first thought that this might be some transmissible disease. So, you know, he conducted these parties to see whether or not pellagra could be transmitted. It turned out it was not. So what was it in foods that prevented pellagra? What was not in corn that caused the disease? So that was the the basic question. And by the 1920s or so, chemical analysis had become more sophisticated, so they were able to analyze the composition of food. And it was Doctor Conrad Alvenheim who in 1937, finally determined that what was missing in corn, what was found in vegetables that were given to, you know, the the other prisoners, was a, a molecule called niacin. And this came to be known as vitamin B3. Now there is a little footnote that needs to be, you know, added here because I said that that the vitamins are substances that that cannot be made in the human body. Actually, bacteria in our gut can make vitamin B3 from tryptophan, which is found in in the diet. It's an amino acid, but no one ever eats enough protein to furnish enough tryptophane for those bacteria to make enough niacin. So though it's a theoretical possibility that it could be made in in the liver, in actual fact it doesn't. It doesn't happen. You need to have niacin from an outside source. But there's another interesting connection to niacin is that here we encounter a vitamin which actually has a function other than just preventing a nutritional disease. Niacin has another amazing property and that is it can reduce blood cholesterol and it can be used as a dietary supplement for people who have high blood cholesterol, which of course is an issue because high cholesterol is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Now the amount of of niacin that is used when it is used as a medication is way, way more than what is used to prevent pellagra. So it's, it's a completely different scenario and the dose that you need is far, far greater than the dose that you need to prevent pellagra. It is a relatively effective medication. It does have one significant side effect which a lot of people can't handle and that's flushing. You become red. Some people get used to that and, and after a while it, it, it goes away. It's not a main lifeline therapy for high cholesterol. We'll see what you actually use later on when we talk about cholesterol specifically, but nevertheless, it, it can be used to lower blood cholesterol levels. Now there are a number of B vitamins besides the the two that we we just mentioned. And in fact, I mean, you can look up at tables and see the B vitamins, some are, are less important. I mean things like riboflavin and biotin, I say not less important in, in, in, in terms of you needing them, but less important because they are very easily available. They're, they're found in virtually every food. So that deficiencies are very unlikely. Anyway, you can read through that, that at, at at your leisure. But the, the question that that really essential to the whole vitamin business is why are these things important? What do vitamins do in the body? And that actually has been answered. What they do is they act as cofactors for enzymes. Now we already explained what enzymes are enzymes are, are biological catalysts. They're proteins that enhance chemical reactions. However, they do not work in isolation. They need to work together. They need to have a partner in order to do what they do. And that partner is the vitamin and they're referred to therefore as Co enzymes. So the B vitamins are Co enzymes in many, many chemical reactions. You know that there are thousands of chemical reactions that go on in our body all the time, including the reactions that generate ATP, right, which is our source of, of of energy. So yes, the B vitamins are involved in energy creation in the body. And this is made use of in in an unscientific fashion by some marketers, for example, Red Bull. As you know, Red Bull gives you wings, right? Which is interesting. And because they're actually now in the middle of a lawsuit launched against them by a clever guy who said that he drank lots of Red Bull, but he never sprouted wings. And, and this is now before the courts, believe it or not. And it's going to be very interesting to see what decision they they come to. You'll notice that Red Bull already has changed its advertising with the spelling of wings. They put 2I S in there. So it's WIIINGS. That's how they spell wings. No one is going to grow those because nobody knows what those are. But, well, it's going to be interesting to see what the outcome is. But anyway, so they claim that the B vitamins that they put in there are responsible for extra energy. No B vitamins are important in energy production. But that would only be a problem if you're weight deficient in B vitamins. If you're not, extra doesn't do you any good. What gives you more energy in Red Bull is the caffeine content. The high caffeine content. That's what gives you energy. Then you have silly products like this. Airborne which supposedly gives you gives you energy. They also base it on B vitamins, which supposedly are in the plant ingredients there, but there probably are some B vitamins in there. But again, if you're not deficient in B vitamins, it doesn't do you any good. You're not getting an extra energy. And yet this is what marketing is all about. You have the Super B energy complex, right? People buy that because they think this is going to to pep them up. Now, vitamin B6, which like all the other B vitamins, is indeed a coenzyme. It's needed for numerous chemical reactions. And it is possible to have a deficiency, although extremely, extremely unlikely in North America. But a vitamin B6 deficiency would would come would come with these symptoms. Now, the problem here, as you can imagine, is that these symptoms characterize many, many medical conditions. So it's very difficult to come to a diagnosis of vitamin 6 deficiency unless you specifically test for vitamins B6 in the blood. And generally you would only do that if you have ruled everything else out. But nevertheless, people take extra B6 just because they think it's going to give them more energy. It doesn't. In fact, it can even produce problems, as you can see in this paper in New England Journal of Medicine about side reactions when you take excessive amounts of of B6. But it is very unlikely to have any deficiency in the B vitamins because they are in virtually everything that that you consume. The one that is interesting where a supplement actually makes sense is folic acid. Folic acid is critical during pregnancy because of the development of the baby's nervous system. There's a condition called spina bifida, which is a malformation of the spine as it starts to form, and this can be a lifelong problem. However, we know that spina bifida can be prevented if there's sufficient folic acid in the diet of the of the mother. And because we know this, governments have made the decision to put folic acid into flour so that any bread that you make with flour and is any pasta that you you make with that flour will have folic acid in it. And ever since this started, we have seen a decline in North America of neurological diseases associated with low folic acid intake. And this has tremendous impact, even financially. Look at the numbers here of what the estimates are. Because someone who suffers from one of these neurological conditions will have to be cared for for the rest of their life. That's a lot of expense. So medical care can save a great deal of money in in with this folic acid supplementation. And that's why women when they are pregnant are told to take a supplement. They're given prenatal vitamins, but the main one in there is is folic acid. Now, there's another absolutely fascinating connection with folic acid, and this has to do with cancer, believe it or not. In 1947, As you can see, researchers discovered that people who were given high doses of folic acid, which at that time was thought to be a good thing to do for for health if they also happen to be cancer patients, it turned out that the cancer was worse. Folic acid had a negative effect. Interestingly enough, this observation also gave rise to a cancer therapy which is widely used today. And that's methotrexate. Why so? Because what the researchers figured out was that folic acid somehow must be enhancing the multiplication of cells. And if you can negate that by blocking the folic acid from attaching to two cells, you could slow down the cancer. And that's what methotrexate does. Methotrexate is very similar in its molecular structure, as you can see, to folic acid. So it fits into a folic acid receptor, but it doesn't activate it and it prevents folic acid from fitting in there. So methotrexate basically inhibits the enzymes because the folic acid cannot fit into the the enzyme receptor. And this is how it can have a treatment on, on cancer. And you know, it's, it's a fascinating story of how something that was an accidental finding, a negative accidental finding, you know, the, the folic acid enhancing cancer, how that turned into a cancer treatment. Well, obviously, if someone has any form of cancer, you do not want to take folic acid supplements, right? Other than pregnancy, you really don't have to worry about folic acid because it is very widespread. The name implies foliage, so it's found in every every fruit and every vegetable. So we don't see folic acid deficiency as such. So the only real concern is during pregnancy, vitamin B12 numerous functions in the body. One of the most important is in the formation of red blood cells. So it's a cofactor in the enzymes that are needed to make red blood cells. It also plays important role in the in the nervous system and it's mechanism of action has been well studied. It is actually produced by bacteria. It is a bacterial by by product and those bacteria inhabit fruits and vegetables. So we have no problem with B12. It's a very complicated molecule, the molecular structure. Look at that. Its chemical name is cyanocobalamin. The reason is if you look at the central atom, the cobalt atom, you see what is attached to that CN. That's cyanide, which scares a lot of people that they're actually consuming cyanide. Well, no, the cyanide is actually embedded in the molecule. It's not free cyanide. So you don't have to worry about cyanide poisoning from from this vitamin. But what you do have to worry about is that the bacteria that form it are only present in meat. Now, originally they must come from plant sources because animals eat plant sources, but the plants do not have enough of the bacteria. Only in the animal's body do those bacteria multiply enough to generate the vitamin B12. And B12, as I I told you, has many important roles. There are many, many conditions that come about from a deficiency, but it generally is very difficult to diagnose a deficiency because it comes with so many symptoms that can also be produced by many other medical problems. But where there is a real problem is with vegans and with people who have Crohn's disease or celiac disease. They do not. In the case of vegans, they just don't have enough of it in the diet. The other, the Crohn's and celiac, it doesn't get properly absorbed through the damaged intestinal tract. And the absorption of vitamin B12 is actually very interesting and very complicated because there's another factor that is needed and it's called intrinsic factor that is needed for the B12 to be absorbed. And as you get older, you produce less and less. So seniors, there is a possibility of being deficient in B12, especially if if they have a very low meat diet. There's also an autoimmune disease which destroys this intrinsic factor. And when that happens, it results in something we call pernicious anemia, which is a a type of vitamin B12 deficiency. But again, this is not something that you guys need to be concerned about. It would be extremely unlikely at your your age unless you have Crohn's disease or celiac disease to to be B12 deficient. It is relatively easily treated because B12 is available in in pill form. It can also be injected and an injection will last a very long time because the body does store some some B12. So that's the story with the B vitamins. They the important thing to remember here is that yes, they are needed and all the metabolic reactions, including the ones that are involved in energy production in the body. But the only time that there is an issue is if you have a deficiency. And it is very, very unlikely in in North America moving on to vitamin A And we right away run into a problem here because this is the kind of picture that you will see on the Internet all the time about vitamin A. It is wrong. Anyone know what is wrong with that picture? vitamin A is only found in animal foods, so how come we see those vegetables there? The reason we see that is because vegetables do campaign contain compounds called carotenoids like beta carotene, which in the body is converted to vitamin A. So they are a source of vitamin A, but they do not contain any vitamin A vitamin A as such is found only in animal products. But unlike with B12, you're not going to be deficient in this vitamin if you are a vegan because you'll be eating lots of vegetables which contain carotenoids which in the body can be converted to vitamin A. Anyway. It was Doctor Elmer McCollum in the early days of the of the 20th century who identified this fat soluble factor that eventually came to be called vitamin A. And he did that because with animal feeding studies, he noticed that when they were fed a certain diet, they got sick. If they were fed a different diet, they didn't get sick. And the question was what was in, in the in the butter and in the egg yolk that prevented this. And eventually that turned out to be vitamin A. But I like to refer to McCollum for another reason. He had a very clever statement that is written up in many nutrition books, which is this eat what you want after you have eaten what you should. And that truly encapsulates, you know, nutrition. Yes, it's very important. Then you have to make sure that you're eating the right things. But if you've eaten all the right things, you can get away with eating some of the wrong things too. And I think that's the the right philosophy anyway. Chemically speaking, vitamin A is not one compound. It's a family of compounds which are very similar to each other, as you can see in in molecular structure. Now most of the time in food it is in the form of of retinol and in the body it gets converted to to others, but they all have the same same activity. You find vitamin A in food mostly in liver, not usually people's favorite food, but that is the greatest source of of vitamin A vitamin A supplements of course are also available. But the reason I show you this is because you see that that it is mentioned in terms of units, international units, not in terms of of weight. And there's a reason for that. And the reason is, as I told you, vitamin A can be found as vitamin A in food, but it can also be made in the body from beta carotene. But the amount of beta carotene that you need to eat weight wise is not the same as a vitamin A. So these international units were concocted in order to allow for that, so that whether, if, if you're taking beta carotene as a supplement and it's marked as having 1000 units, it will have the same effect on your body as pure vitamin A that is labeled as 1000 international units, even though the the weight of those may not be the same. So why? Why vitamin A? What, what, what does it do? Again, it's important as a Co catalyst. It's involved in bone growth and reproduction, immune system health and very important in the health of of the skin and mucous membranes. And obviously it's essential to have enough of it. Again, in our context here, very unlikely to have a deficiency because it is found in so many foods. But in case of deficiency, as you can see what the symptoms can appear, very often the first symptom that is noted in case of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness. It doesn't mean literally blind, it just means that you see more poorly in in in the dark. And this is what has given rise to the story of eating carrots in order to improve your vision, which as you can imagine now has some theoretical basis, right? Because if you really were deficient in vitamin A, carrots contain beta carotene, the body would make vitamin A from it and you would treat the problem. But vitamin A deficiency, while it is very rare in in North America, is unfortunately quite widespread in the developing world, mostly because their diet is based on rice and rice does not contain vitamin A, It does not contain beta carotene. And This is why we see unusual high number of cases of impaired vision and even blindness in children in the developing world. And the tragedy here is that this is a problem that can be quite easily solved by genetic modification, because today with modern technology we can implant a gene into rice that codes for the production of beta carotene. It also makes the rice yellow, hence the term golden rice, which will have enough beta carotene to prevent vitamin A deficiency. The same thing can be done with potatoes. Golden potatoes can be made to contain enough beta carotene to prevent vitamin A deficiency. It isn't happening. Why not? Because the activists out there who demonstrate against genetic modification without having the slightest idea of what they're talking about, right? It just sounds high. Technology must must be bad. Why? Because it is the big companies that are are doing it. And they say, oh, well, why? Why do this? Why not just give beta carotene tablets to these children? Oh, yeah, Well, good luck with that. Trying to distribute beta carotene tablets, you know, the to children in the developing world. There is also an interesting downside here, a cancer connection once more. It turned out in a study where smokers were given beta carotene hoping that it would reduce the risk of cancer. Because beta carotene acts as an antioxidant, it actually ended up enhancing the cancer we still can't explain today, while while that is why that is, But if you're a smoker, you sure do not want to take any beta carotene supplements. Otherwise, beta carotene is certainly safe. I don't think there's any reason to take it because we don't have vitamin A deficiency in North America. The biggest side effect you would see from beta carotene supplements would be that your skin starts to turn the color of carrots because that's where the extract comes from. The only time that there would be a danger with taking in vitamin A is in preformed vitamin A, the actual vitamin A, Not not beta carotene, but pure vitamin A, which is found in liver. It turns out that eating polar bear liver can be deadly. We know this because explorers in the Arctic when they had a shortage of food, resorted to eating polar bear and they developed toxicity from eating polar bear liver. So if anyone ever offers you that, say no thank you, stick with your chicken liver or beef liver or or whatever. Again, in, in terms of, of vitamin A deficiency, yes, you can treat it with vitamin A supplements or beta carotene supplements. It's not going to happen in developing world. That's not, that's just not a, a practical solution. There's again, you know, a lot of knowledge about about vitamin A and here's a very interesting case report showing you that toxicity can happen. Here is a guy, physical culture guy, you know, muscle builder who thought that vitamin A was important for making muscle. There's no connection to muscle. So even, I mean, the concept was wrong and yet, you know, he ended up in hospital with vitamin A overdose. And you know, there's a typical interesting and case report. But vitamin A does have benefits. Some of you may be familiar with retin a cream which can be put on the skin. Deficiency in the skin of vitamin A can result in in splotches and and and wrinkles. It isn't miraculous, but it it does have some effect. Where vitamin A cream really does have an effect is with acne. In mild cases of acne it it improves the condition. But if you have serious acne then it's a different form of vitamin A that is needed. And this is a medication called Accutane, which is very similar to the vitamin A that you find in liver. The the geometry of the molecule is a little bit different. Accutane is in many cases with acne, it's, it's almost miraculous. Here is a classic example of that. And in this case, the picture is realistic. You really do have such solutions. But there is a big but that comes with this with Accutane. Anyone know what you can get that? But that's not the big problem. You can't take it when you're pregnant. That is a huge issue. This is something that you must absolutely keep in mind because this could be disastrous. Accutane is teratogenic. Teratogenic means that it interferes with the development of the embryo and it's not a rare condition. That's why doctors will not prescribe Accutane unless there's a guarantee that there are two birth control methods being used because the risk of teratogenicity is is is very high. Now obviously this does not apply to to men, but this is something that you know, you have to keep in mind and you know, just another example that there are substances that in one condition can be very useful but detrimental in another. Let's now look at vitamin D Vitamin D is maybe the most studied vitamin and it too was introduced by Elmer McCollum just like vitamin A in in 1921. He had looked at history mostly of the industrial revolution in England when a condition known as Ricketts was rampant. Ricketts is a disease where the bones don't form properly. The bones are very soft and you get these characteristic bold legs. Now why was this rampant during the industrial revolution in England? Because the skies were full of smoke from all the steam engines, all the steam machinery that that was being used blocking out sunlight. Not that you have all that much sunlight in England anyway, but it was being blocked out. So the kids were not getting enough sunlight. They didn't understand in those days, they didn't know what was causing the ball legs. It was Elmer McCollum who eventually figured it all out that it was due to a deficiency in the body. A deficiency due to sunlight? How could that be? Sunlight doesn't contain anything. Sunlight is just for a form of radiation. Well, sunlight enhances a chemical reaction going on in the body that converts cholesterol into vitamin D. It is also possible to have supplements of vitamin D, which was figured out in the early 1900s and the most famous such supplement was cod liver oil, which is very high in vitamin D and this was given to children routinely up to the 1950s. I know this because I have horrific memory of this. I just think of this now and it brings up this horrific taste that I had to put up with when when I was a kid being pummeled with cast with with cod liver oil, which just may be the most foul tasting thing that exists in the world. But why is vitamin D called the sunshine vitamin? Whereas sunshine doesn't contain any any vitamin, but the body contains the precursor to this vitamin. That precursor is a form of cholesterol, and sunlight begins the sequence of reactions that eventually convert that cholesterol derivative into vitamin D. This is why we say that you should get at least 1520 minutes of outdoor sunshine a day. That's enough to to have your body maintain its stores of of vitamin D, but also these days it is put into dairy products. So that counters any possible deficiency. The deficiency is most characterized by weakness of of bones, osteoporosis, weakening of the bones to the extent that fractures become more likely. But besides the structural effects on bone of vitamin D, there are many claims that are made about its supposed benefits. Here are some of them. Vitamin D reduces respiratory tract infections. These are all claims that are widespread in social media and on on the Internet. The fact is that it just isn't true. It does not have any effect on on respiration improves depression and mental well-being. No, there are no studies that that that show that can it prevent arthritis? No, you look through the scientific literature, there's nothing. All you will come across are just social media and you know, websites that try to sell you the the supplements. Can it prevent multiple sclerosis? No, but you go to some of these websites, you know about multiple sclerosis treatments and they will all claim that that vitamin D works. The most definitive paper is this one principal results of the vitamin D and Omega-3 trial. It's called the VITAL trial, of course, cleverly designed so that the word that the acronym should come out to to VITAL. And this was a trial in which a large number of people were given vitamin D and omega-3 fats or only vitamin D or only omega-3 fats. It was actually very well carried out study and the amount of vitamin D used was 2000 IU, which is a very high, high level. And as you can see it didn't have any effect. And the reason for that is because the problems only occur if you have a deficiency in vitamin D, But if there's no deficiency, then there's no point in taking extra vitamin D. And so This is why, you know, based on on this study, the recommendation is that no, you don't need to do routine blood tests for vitamin D, which used to be done by physicians across the board. You don't need to do that because the evidence is that even when people have low blood levels of vitamin D, giving them supplements doesn't solve the problem. So this this was really quite a landmark study. But nevertheless, people still take their vitamin D thinking that it's going to prevent heart disease, prevent cancer, prevent arthritis, whatever. At least there is no risk with taking vitamin D, certainly not up to the 2000 IU level. I would say that that if you really are a hermit and you're living in a cave in Canada where you live in a dark room and you never go outside, all right, then consider taking vitamin D. But if you spend any, any time outside and you consume any dairy products, you're not going to have a deficiency. The only time that that doctors these days do prescribe it is together with calcium because vitamin D is needed to absorb calcium, right? I mean, that's basically how bones are are are formed. And if you supply calcium, the body needs vitamin D to absorb it. So if there should be the deficiency, you can then correct it by giving the vitamin D together with the with the calcium. But it's very questionable if that works either. As you will see when we talk about calcium, vitamin E, vitamin E, like vitamin A, is not one compound. It is a set of compounds. All of them have the ability to prevent vitamin deficiency diseases. Vitamin E is needed, as you can see, for skeletal growth, cardiacs, muscle growth, smooth muscles. It is once again very unlikely that anyone in North America will have a A deficiency. Yes, it is needed for the formation of red blood cells. It is needed for the proper functioning of the immune system. And you know, these are the kind of things that marketers use because they will make a statement. Vitamin E is very important for the proper functioning of the immune system. Therefore, you need a supplement. Well, those two don't necessarily go together. I mean, yeah, you may need a supplement if you don't have enough of it in the diet. But the amount that we need in the diet is so little and it's found in so many foods that, again, you're not like the other deficiency. The popularity of vitamin E began in the 1940s with two Canadian doctors who theorized without any real scientific background that vitamin E was important for prevention of heart disease and also for prevention of cancer. They just hypothesized this on the basis of the fact, like other vitamins, vitamin E is needed for many important biochemical reactions in the body. And there was really a lot of people who listen to the shoot, to the shoots, because there was no real treatment back then, no effective treatment of cardiovascular disease. So they would try vitamin E. But since that time, we have had a large number of studies of vitamin E and the the results over and over again are that taking supplements does not do any good. So the bottom line, there is no clinical research that shows that taking vitamin E supplements does does any good. Because vitamin E is found in so many foods, you're not going to be deficient. Neither is it likely to be different in vitamin KA. Vitamin K is important for blood coagulation. In fact, the word the K comes from from the Danish word for coagulate, which starts with K because that's where the coagulation effect was, was discovered. It is certainly important, the body needs it, but again, deficiency is very unlikely. And like vitamin A and vitamin E, it's not just one compound that in this case it's a couple of related compounds. And these together are very important in blood chemistry in, in controlling how your blood coagulates. As you you can read here, it's very important in how calcium is, is being delivered to to the bones. But the amount that you need is 2 to 3 micrograms a day, which is is a trivial amount. Everyone gets that. Now the only time that you do have to be concerned about vitamin K is if you are already taking an anticoagulant drug or so-called blood thinner like Coumadin, which some people take after stroke or after heart attack. Because then if you take vitamin K, you can in fact enhance, you can decrease the effect, right? Because vitamin K is a coagulant. So you are countering the effect of the anticoagulant. This is why people who are taking Coumadin or on heparin are told not to eat broccoli, because broccoli is a source of vitamin K and many other vegetables or source of vitamin K. Again, this does not affect you. You don't have to worry about eating broccoli. Eat as much broccoli as as you can stand, which probably is not very much, but don't worry about anything to do with your blood coagulating. Finally we come to maybe the most famous vitamin, which is vitamin C Vitamin C is interesting because of course we need it, we can't make it. But we share that problem with three other creatures. Amazingly, the red vented bulbo, the Guinea pig and the fruit eating bat cannot make their own vitamin C. They have to have it in their diet, just like us. How anyone ever discovered that is is a mystery, but so is so it is. Vitamin C deficiency results in the disease called scurvy, terrible disease. The gums start to recede, you start to bleed, you get sores. This was a classic disease seen amongst sailors on long ocean voyages. Jacques Cartier noticed this when it came to Quebec. In fact, it was well noted that his sailors developed this disease. They didn't know what it was in in in those days and many of his sailors perished, never were able to to return to to Europe. But some believe it or not were cured because the natives had a remedy that they told Cartier, and that was to make a tea from the leaves of a spruce tree and to give that to the sick patients. And believe it or not, that was curative. We understand why contains vitamin C Obviously that was totally unknown at that time, but it was interesting observation. But it was James Lind, Scottish physician in the 18th century, who made the most important observation. He carried out what is today regarded as one of the first ever clinical trials. They had this scourge on ships, on long ocean voyages. Sailors were dying. Why? Because what was their diet? It was hard baked biscuits and salted meat. That was the only thing that could be kept. I mean, those voyages, you know it, it took you weeks to come from Europe to to America. They were deficient in vitamin C. They came down with scurvy and lint. Thought that this may be something to do with the diet. So he actually organized this, amazingly, this clinical trial where some sailors were given some foods, other were given different foods. Luckily, some of them were given citrus fruits, and it turned out that the ones who were given citrus fruits did not come down with scurvy. And even if they did given the citrus fruit, the scurvy would resolve. He wrote this up in a famous treatise on scurvy, documented it, and you know, you would think that this would have been immediately adopted. Well, it wasn't because there was no Wi-Fi, there was no Internet, there were no cell phones. News didn't spread like wildfire like like today. It took years until the British Navy began to institute giving lime extracts to their sailors. Interesting enough, Captain James Cook independently discovered that when he gave sauerkraut to his crew members, they were also spared scurvy because sauerkraut is also a very good source of of vitamin C. But it wasn't until much later, 1795, that the British Navy began to provide a daily supply of lime or lemon juice. And all the ships were equipped with that. The reason that it was mostly lime juice is because limes grew in, in, in the Caribbean, which was in those those days, most of the Caribbean islands were British. So they had a lot of lime. And until the early 1900s, it was a tradition on British ships to always have a barrel of lime juice. Now this of course, by that time was symbolic because they had a, a, a decent diet. But it is also the reason that Brits are sometimes called limease because of the consumption of of lime. The molecule that actually is vitamin C was first isolated by Albert and Gergy, who actually isolated it from paprika in, in, in Hungary. And the molecular structure of it was discovered by Hayworth, a British chemist. And there it is. As you can see, it's a relatively simple molecular structure. And both Hayworth and, and St. Gergy got the Nobel Prize, not not exactly for that, but for related work. So that the question today is whether or not vitamin C can do anything beside prevent the common cold, right? Because we saw, for example, with niacin that it had a ability to lower cholesterol, right? We saw with folic acid that had the ability to to prevent spina bifida. So could vitamin C do anything? Well, the most popular story is that it can help treat the common cold. And this idea was launched by Linus Pauling, probably the greatest chemist of the last century of the of the 1900s, double Nobel Prize winner. He never campaigned for a Nobel Prize. No, no sane person does that. It's the, you know, it's only someone who's insane and who thinks that, that Norway as a country gives out the, the Peace Prize. And now he, he wants to, you know, we'll get back at everyone by invading Greenland after he's invaded Minnesota. I mean, what we're seeing in the world today, it is unbelievable. I mean, there's no, no other word to describe the the lunacy that is, is going on. Anyway, Pauling got the Peace Prize for opposing a nuclear weapon development and he also got the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, basically for developing the concept of the chemical bond, and his book Valence in the Chemical Bond is a book that was used around the world in in introductory chemistry courses. Interestingly enough, he is the only one in history to have two unshared Nobel Prizes, which is a rarity because most Nobel Prizes, you know, shared two by two or three people. The only one who has two unshared Nobel Prizes. Curiously, this extremely brilliant man wrote a book, Vitamin C and the Common Cold, based on his own anecdotal experience and that of his wife. A guy who had written hundreds of peer reviewed papers in the world's top journals, writes this book, totally unscientific. And he was, you know, associated with vitamin C and curing the common cold. Well, because of who he was, scientists said we better investigate this. Maybe he's got something. I mean, he had something and so many other thing. So they did carry the experiments first with Marine recruits. Marine recruits are great for carrying out such experiments. Why? Because they will do exactly what they're supposed to do. You tell a Marine recruit to jump, The only question they ask is when and how high. If you tell them take vitamin C, the only thing they'll ask is when do I take it and how much do do I take. It turned out that they even taking 2 grams a day, there was no protection against the common cold. Now there is some anecdotal evidence that a gram an hour for four hours at the very first sign of a cold can reduce the severity. This is purely anecdotal evidence and if you tell your parents this, I'm going to deny that you heard it here, but I think that this is true. I've now kind of live long enough and have had enough cold onsets with which I have tried it. And what I find is that chewing the chewable version at that dose for three or four hours, once, once an hour, if you catch it right at the beginning of the development cold, I think you can stop it. But that's just between us. Do not go telling anyone that I said that. This is totally unscientific. It is all anecdotal. Totally unscientific and anecdotal is the belief that vitamin C can treat the cancer. It cannot do that. There are clinics that use intravenous vitamin C on cancer patients charging a lot of money. They claim that of course pharmaceutical companies and the government want to keep this knowledge secret because they want to keep selling their expensive, ineffective drugs, and that the FDA wants it banned. I mean, absolutely this. This is nonsense. There's no deficiency of vitamin C in North America because it is found in virtually every fruit and vegetable. It does not treat cancer, the cold business. Well, as you know, there's nuances to that. There may be something there. So what is the bottom line here in terms of vitamin supplements? Since their discovery, vitamins have been looked on as sort of magical ingredients in food that that we should have because they're going to pep us up. Indeed, the first cereal that had vitamins added to it was known as pep cereal because it was supposed to pep you up, you know, playing mostly on this idea that the B vitamins are involved in energy production. Some of these ads today, you know, are laughable. And you could never, ever have something like that. The wife looks cuter because she takes vitamin supplements. Gosh, honey, you seem to thrive on cooking, cleaning and dusting and I'm all tuckered out by closing time. What's the answer? Vitamins, darling. I always get my vitamins. That's what makes her look cute, right? And that's what keeps her cleaning all day at at home. I mean, obviously today you'd never ever see anything like that. But in the those days, you know, this was quite common that vitamins would solve all your problems. Say you put them into Donuts and that would make them into healthy, healthy foods. Then they were all the, the cereals that had vitamins. And today, as you know, you're going to any pharmacy, you going to any health food store and there are hundreds and hundreds of different kinds of vitamins, single vitamins, combinations of vitamins. You know, you can get everything. The problem is that that people buy into this stuff. Why? Because they have lost confidence in the scientific community and governments. Why? Because didn't prevent COVID or sometimes the wrong information was was given about COVID. People think that that nature is benign and if we just fill ourselves with natural products, there's no hazard and there can only be benefits. But of course, we don't go by anecdotes or beliefs. We go by the scientific studies. And there are numerous, numerous studies that have been done with vitamin supplementation, small doses, higher doses, combinations of vitamins, single vitamins. You can, you know, look through all of these and the evidence is that taking extra doses of vitamins doesn't bear any fruit because it is unlikely that that you have deficiency. And you know, you see the conclusions in male physicians aged 65 years long term use of daily multi weight did not provide cognitive benefits and the other studies no cancer benefit, no heart disease benefit. So in you know, what do we conclude from from from this? This is it in a nutshell. Beta carotene, vitamin, possibly high dose of vitamin A can be harmful. So you want to play around with those while you know the benefits of folic acid and there is no magic in in vitamins unless you have a deficiency. Yeah, you have Berry Berry, you better go and take thiamine. You have pellagra, you better look for niacin. If you have scurvy, you go for vitamin C, but none of you are going to have Berry Berry or pellagra or, or or scurvy. Just as a final footnote here, there are some products that are labeled as vitamins which are not vitamins. I mean, we discussed what vitamins are. There's only 13 of them, but you can go into some stores and see something called vitamin 15 or vitamin B17. This usually is a substance called amygdalyn, which is extracted from apricot kernels and is sold as a treatment for cancer. It's absolute nonsense. There's no such thing as vitamin B17. So yeah, vitamins are important. You don't want to have any deficiency because that will be potentially catastrophic. But if you have a proper balanced diet, you don't have to to to worry. Now, one question that you know goes to your mind. OK. Do I have a balanced diet? I mean, it's, it's the stuff that they're feeding me in the residences. Is that the balanced diet? Well, I think that that actually is because we do have nutritionists who design that. But the question comes up not only by you, but, you know, general public. What if I have nutritional gaps? You know what, if I'm not eating exactly right, why not take vitamin supplement? I'm not going to say don't, because I don't think there's any risk with taking that. I think the chance that you do have a nutritional gap that this is going to fill in, I think it is unlikely. Maybe not impossible, but unlikely. I don't think there's a whole lot of good to, but there's probably no no risk in in in take taking these in most cases. I think it's soothing to the soul. You think you're doing something you know for yourself and even if it just has a psychological effect, OK. But if you're looking for the road towards longevity, it's not going to be lined with vitamins. I don't know what it is. I haven't found it yet. I, I keep looking. Maybe we'll find it next week when we look at the other micronutrients, which are the minerals, see whether or not those are going to make us live longer. All right, that's it for today. None. We had a quick question and it is concerned. I. Is there a reason why? I guess it could be a problem. I don't know why he was not sure he was like since he was 16. She looked up. She's like. So this has something to do with nutrition regarding exams, it's on Mark. I was told I have accessibility and so I guess that's like 33% everyone that they need. But apparently I have to like speak to you directly regarding the extra time when it comes to like an online exam. No, it's all. OK, because we won't get 3. Hours, OK, like an hour and a half. OK, OK, OK, OK. Which is right people physically hold. These girls benefit from your disability. Vitamins that help ADHD numbers that's. A question that's often. Yeah, yeah, she was totally fine. She came out of it and then she was totally fine. I guess it was like this is the same and then another time before she ended up having in the hallway. So that was also bad. So then what what about supplements or vitamin supplements that are targeted towards children? Because I feel like children have relatively, well, not always, but they often have like balanced diets because it's very heavily monitored. It is so. Yeah, yeah, it really is. I never realized until this class how sort of like inefficient it is to tell my mom. Because there's 100,100 thousand dietary supplements that are on the market in North America. That's crazy. I'm going to go tell my mom. It's just crazy. Thank you so much. First question, is it true that well, it's directly proportional to the? Amount of time that you spend. So yes, that is, that is true. The the question is whether you're spending so little that that you would need a supplement that's unlikely because you only need about 15 minutes of. So that really would have to be that you don't go out at all. You know. And also, I mean it doesn't, it doesn't mean that it has to be every day either. You know. But if you think that, you know you're not getting it. Vitamin D is cheap you. Know. Taking a taking 1000 IUA day is something to break your bank account and if it makes you feel better, you'll do it 'cause sometimes just thinking that's something that's good for you. But what? Career wise. Career wise, you're too young. Well, I mean if you're interested in that then that pretty good one or or dietician. Dietician is actually the space is pretty much sought after profession to get jobs and possibly in research with some company that produces, you know, some food that or nutritional product or you know, supplements or whatever. Yeah, but in in academia, most of the people who are involved in nutrition research have a nutrition background. That's where they come, come. From. Anyway, wherever you think you're going to end up. That's not where you're going to end up, Yeah. Oh OK I see. And so I just want to ask you did did he mention one of the lectures? OK and do you know it's almost the truth. Got my 2 questions with two answers that I wanted. Thank you. I'm like I mean this class is my bird class so I need to. You'll be fine. Are you freshman? Yeah. Thank you so much for answering my questions. You know the the professor.
